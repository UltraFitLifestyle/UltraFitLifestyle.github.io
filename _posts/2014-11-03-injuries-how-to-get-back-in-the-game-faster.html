<p>Here I sit this morning with a bum ankle and some sort of flu-y, cold-like bug. I am SO bummed, because today is the start date of my Holiday Survival Fitness Group!! All I feel like doing is sleeping and sipping ginger ale. My ankle is tender from a minor injury sustained following my first 1/2 marathon. I ran hard, and had no rest day afterwards. This weekend’s run aggravated it, and now I am on ice.</p>

<p>I am not the type to want to hang on the sidelines long. In fact, I should rested up more post-race and perhaps and I would not have this tricky ankle. During my long dance career, I learned that the show must go on. I learned how to get myself better quick. So, here are my tips for getting back in the game ASAP:</p>

<p><span class="bold">1) Listen to your body!</span> The weekend after my race, I should have listened; but I insisted on keeping up with the running club and ran another 13 miles on an ankle that was begging for a break. Your body <span class="italic">will</span> tell you what it needs. I finally listened early Sunday morning, when I found myself limping over to try to put on my running clothes. And, again this morning, when my body ached all over and begged me to cancel my morning class. Rest is the only way to heal. I repeat: Rest is the ONLY way to heal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">2) Practice self-care.</span> Ice is my best friend right now as far as my ankle goes. I got a massage last week, and continue to use my foam roller, self- massage, and lots of stretching. It is important to be proactive about an injury to get back on top sooner.</p>

<p><span class="bold">3) Be smart, but don’t linger.</span> I already mentioned the rest thing, so be smart about it. If you get back in the game too soon, you might injure yourself worse. However, champions don’t linger on and “milk it.” The sooner you get moving again, the closer you will be back at top form. Once your body tells you clearly that you are ready, the get back in the game!!! Carefully at first…..don’t overdo it. Or you’ll be back on ice again!</p>

<p>Time for my ice and ginger ale.....separately. <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>
