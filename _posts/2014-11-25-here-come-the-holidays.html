<p>It’s the day before Thanksgiving. There’s a huge winter storm looming and threatening my holiday travel. Pressure is on to get there in time, do the family thing, and get home for work. Welcome to the holidays!!!!!</p>

<p>When I was younger, the holidays were a time I was happy to head home, drink and eat like a glutton, and have nothing to think about. I am a Wife and Mom now, have a mortgage, and a career I cherish. So, there are a LOT more factors influencing how I spend my time. And, as far as the gluttony that accompanies the holidays, it is no longer an issue for me.</p>

<p>Here’s why:</p>

<p>I used to look forward to a holiday like Thanksgiving as a day I could just “let go” and eat whatever and how much I pleased. I still do that, however, there was a time when I was truly unhealthy about the whole situation. I knew there would be a ton of awesome food and I was going to eat it. I would starve myself all day or perhaps even the day before to “get ready” for the BIG meal.</p>

<p>How silly! I hindsight, I see the folly of my ways, because the plan would backfire on me once I sat at the table. I was so ravenous, I over ate. Then, I felt guilty about it. Later, I <span class="italic">physically</span> felt awful and overstuffed.</p>

<p>Today, I look at Thanksgiving as just another day and just another meal. I take small portions of the foods I cherish most for nostalgic reasons and what I find delicious. I consider myself an athlete, so I fuel my body as such. After Thanksgiving dinner, I still want to <span class="italic">feel</span> like an athlete.</p>

<p>YOU are the only one in charge of what you eat. Make good choices. Be <span class="italic">thankful</span> for all you have and all that you have become.</p>

<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>
