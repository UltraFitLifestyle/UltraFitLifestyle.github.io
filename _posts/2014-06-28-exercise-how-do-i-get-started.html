<p><img class="left" width="150" height="150" src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/deadlift.jpg" />I have had a few friends lately let me know that my Ultra Fit Lifestyle idea seems like an impossible thing for them. They are just setting out on their fitness journey. They feel they need to lose weight, but it is just very overwhelming to them to simply START. So, how DO you get started when you feel like you are too overweight, too old, or too hopeless?

<p>The answer is to simply START!</p>

<p>Take one baby step TODAY to move you in the right direction. Fitness and success are like a snowball effect; once you get it rolling, it is easier and more fun to keep the momentum going. I do not advise jumping on some crazy restrictive diet if you are unhappy with your body, or trying to run a mile if you haven’t run in years or ever at all. Start with something small. Here are a few suggestions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>eliminate ONE habitual item today that you KNOW is doing you no good. For example: Diet Coke, a bowl of ice cream late at night, finishing your kid’s lunch....</li>
	<li>Drink ONE extra glass of water where you did not drink it yesterday</li>
	<li>Park in the farthest away parking spot to your office or at the grocery store, instead of the closest</li>
	<li>Add 10 squats or push-ups (heck, add ONE push-up if that’s all you’ve got!) somewhere in your day.</li>
	<li>During the commercial break of your favorite show, do a little stretching</li>
</ul>

<p>Just pick ONE thing. Once you do that, add one MORE thing the next day. And, then do both of those things and one MORE thing on the third day. You will get into the swing of it in no time! Be sure to replace the BAD habit with something GOOD and new. If you usually snack on chips and dip while you watch the game, switch to some exotic sounding hummus and carrots instead.</p>

<p>There’s a saying that goes something like this: How do you eat an elephant? Answer: One bite at a time. You cannot do everything at once. If you are trying to lose weight, look, and feel different, it is not going to happen over night. You CAN get there; you CAN achieve your most desired fitness goal. But, it will take consistent effort over time. Consistent effort over time!!! I had to say it twice for all the people that give up after 2 weeks because “it’s not working!”</p>

<p>You can do it!!! Start today!! If you need some help, <a href="{{site.url}}/contact-rachel">CONTACT ME</a> and I will get you on the right path to the Ultra Fit Lifestyle that is right for YOU!</p>
