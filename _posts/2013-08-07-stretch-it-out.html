<p>I think the world would be a better place if everyone got up in the morning and did 5-10 mins of stretching. It would be so simple and easy; but what is easy to do is just as easy <span class="italic">NOT</span> to do. Unfortunately, most people (including VERY fit and active people) neglect or skip stretching altogether!! I have been a dancer all my life and stretching is a huge deal for us dancers, but I still sometimes get slack on my stretching routine. So, why is stretching so wonderful??</p>

<p class="bold">Top 5 Reasons You Should Stretch EVERY Day!</p>

<ol>
<li><span class="bold">Reduces stress!!</span> So, any of you out there feel like you DON’T need stress reduction? We all need help in this department. A bit, to a lot (yoga) of stretching can help relieve some of the tension that stress causes to build up in our muscles. Especially where it is naturally stored: the neck, shoulders, and hips. Also, since stretching IS a form of exercise, it gets some good, healthy endorphins flowing to put you in a better mood! So, a definite great way to start your day!!</li>
<li><span class="bold">Increased circulation.</span> It has been argued whether or not stretching improves sports performance. Stretching has definitely been proven to increase blood flow to the muscles for more effective muscle movement in general. But, DO NOT use stretching as your warm-up!!! Always do at least a 5 min warm-up that involves walking, light jogging in place, or some sort of movement that gets the muscles a bit warm before you do any heavy stretching. Think of a gel ice pack: when you take it out of the freezer, it is rock hard and would hurt if you dropped it on your foot! You have to move it around a knead it for a couple of minutes so that it is pliable. Same with your muscles. Don’t stretch ice cold muscles; even better to do the bulk of your stretching at the end of a workout or class so that the muscles are nice and warm!!</li>
<li><span class="bold">Flexibility.</span> Well, this one is obvious. Some of us dancers desire much more flexibility than the average person, but a bit of flexibility is god for us all!</li>
<li><span class="bold">Increased Range of Motion.</span> So, the flexibility bit plays into this one. But, think about it: if your Achilles tendon is tight, due to your calves being tight, it causes less range of motion in your ankle. Thus, walking, hiking, running, or jumping are less effective, sometimes to the point where injury occurs. Same applies to the larger muscle groups.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Low back Pain Reduction.</span> I have an absolute sorceress for a massage therapist. I am amazed at how when my low back hurts, she starts by working on my quadriceps!! Our body parts are not all separate entities. Everything is connected and works together. So, if one major muscle group is too tight; it WILL have an effect on other areas. Tight hamstrings, quads, shoulders, and hips can all contribute to low back pain. And, ain’t nobody got time for low back pain!!!</li>
</ol>

<p>A couple other tips on stretching:</p>

<ol>
<li><span class="bold">Do not bounce!</span> That is so very 80s of you if you are still bouncing and ripping muscle fibers. The key nowadays, is active stretching and sometimes static stretching. Active stretching means moving through the stretches in a slow, but constant progression. Static is where you hold the stretch. Dancers tend to stick with static stretches, but when holding static stretches, be sure to hold for a minimum of 30 seconds. That gives the muscle a chance to relax and release slightly. BOTH active and static stretches in combination yield best results.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Notice the discomfort, but beware of pain.</span> Stretching generally produces an UGH feeling that leads to an AHHH feeling after a little bit of work. Now, dancers like me are special creatures, and we LOVE that “pain” of stretching. But, we all must be mindful of going too far. When you are stretching, you are lengthening the muscle fibers and creating miniscule tears that heal and increase flexibility and range of motion. But, you want to avoid the BIG tears in muscle fiber that cause injury. So, stretch to the point of <span class="italic">slight</span> discomfort, but not pain.</li>
<li><span class="bold">BREATHE.</span> If you hold your breath while you stretch, your body goes into survival mode. And the muscles will not relax. They are going to hold on to as much oxygen as possible. So, nice long and deep breaths are best!</li>
<li><span class="bold">Keep it up!</span> If you stop stretching, as in all workouts and fitness, you will gradually lose the gains you have made. So try to fit in a little bit every day or as often as possible. My best time to stretch if it is not a formal stretching session is during the commercials of my favorite TV show.  I focus on one stretch, like a hamstring stretch during each commercial break. Admit it, commercials are worthless anyway; so why not use the time wisely?!</li>
</ol>
<p>Everyone has a different level of flexibility, so “be where you are,” as I say in my ballet classes. You CAN make improvements, but it will take work and focus. As in weight loss and getting ripped, it won’t happen over night, so keep at it. Consistent effort will get you the results you want EVERY time!!</p>
