<p><span class="bold">The Ugly Truth.</span> This phrase has haunted me the last couple of days since reading it in a blog over at <a href="http://scdlifestyle.com/2013/07/ugly-truth-about-reversing-digestive-disease/" target="_blank">SCD Lifestyle</a>.</p>

<p>The Ugly Truth is that truth that we all try to ignore. For me, it is that I kind of DO use my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease" target="_blank">Crohn’s disease</a> as a crutch. A security blanket. An excuse. Kinda lame to admit, but it is the Ugly Truth. I consider myself pretty blessed and quite healthy by normal Crohn’s standards. A lot of people living with this disease are suffering greatly every day: no energy, cannot work, in huge amounts of pain, and feeling like they can’t leave the house. I watch what I eat, use Shakeology daily, do my workouts, and do what I can to control stress. BUT…..I am not as vigilant as I COULD be. I get lazy or busy and don’t keep my fridge stocked with healthy choices like I should. I get weak and careless and eat a couple of chocolate chip cookies with my daughter.</p>

<p>Now, not saying a couple of cookies are a bad thing for an normal person. For me, even the smallest amount of sugar and flour is one step in the direction of a Crohn’s flare. I get a bit complacent because I AM so very healthy thanks to Shakeology, Beachbody, and my fitness level. But, I still found myself at the hospital yesterday with an IV in my arm. A needle poked in your arm and a bag of nasty poison/medicine dripped in over a 2-hour time period is one good way to keep things real. I went in for my treatment because it was time for it; I get it every 8 weeks. I <span class="italic">sort of</span> felt like it was necessary….but to be frank, I felt AWFUL afterwards. I felt worse that I did when I went in. Now, not saying the effects of the medicine are not helpful today…but, could nutrition be the BEST, most cost efficient way to control my health condition with little or NO side effects?? (Side note, I have a couple THOUSAND dollars worth of medical bills on my desk that I am slowly, but surely paying off. ONE remicade treatment is $7000. My insurance pays 80%. I get a treatment every 8 weeks. You do the math…)</p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.breakingtheviciouscycle.com/" target="_blank">www.breakingtheviciouscycle.com</a> or <a href="http://scdlifestyle.com/about-the-scd-diet/" target="_blank">www.scdlifestyle.com</a> you can take a look at what the Specific Carb diet is all about. The concept is excellent. A person with Crohn’s or other IBD conditions simply cannot process certain foods. In fact, certain foods aggravate our situation. So, the simple solution is just DON’T eat those things!! However, the tough part is that it takes more work and discipline NOT to eat a slice of pizza or a piece of bread. Now why is that so difficult??</p>

<p>The same concept applies to those who want to change their body composition (i.e. LOSE the flab!!). We all know that it IS difficult to just say <span class="italic">NO</span> to certain things. We want the immediate satisfaction of the taste of the chocolate chip cookie in our mouth. The crunch. The f*** it, I am careful MOST of the time, so this time doesn’t count….the Ugly Truth.</p>

<p><span class="bold">So, what is YOUR “Ugly Truth”??</span> You may not have a chronic condition. You may just be unsatisfied with how your body looks or feels right now. I know a LOT of people who are either <span class="italic">way</span> over their ideal body weight OR just a few measly pounds away from it. So, what’s holding them and YOU back? I am guessing it is the Ugly Truth. The Rock Star drinks. The Starbucks Vanilla Frapp. The Newcastle Beer. The late night bag of chips. The inconsistency of your workouts. You may not actually KNOW what your Ugly Truth is until you really take a look at your habits.</p>

<p class="bold">So, how to figure it out?</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="bold">Track it.</span> Go get a little notebook and carry it around in your pocket for the next 7-10 days. Write down EVERY single thing that goes in your mouth. From the first cup of coffee in the morning and what goes in that coffee to the last midnight snack. And everything in between. That includes finishing your kid’s sandwich, a handful of pretzels in the break room, and the iced tea with lunch. You might be surprised at what you are consuming without thinking. If you are not a pen and paper person, use your smartphone: start a memo, or get an app such as www.myfitnesspal.com (I am on MyFitnessPal @racheltipton)</li>
<li><span class="bold">Own it.</span> Admit to yourself that you are in fact consuming some things that need to GO! Take a look at <span class="italic">WHY</span> you consume them. Do you just feel like you can’t make it through the rest of the day without a quad shot drink from Starbucks or a Rock Star? When you get home from work, are you craving a few handfuls of chips before you start supper? Is your life so stressful that you just can’t WAIT to get to Happy Hour? If you really want life change, you have to face the Ugly Truth no matter what it is…..I warn you it is <span class="italic">NOT</span> easy and usually <span class="italic">NOT</span> pretty….hence we call it the UGLY Truth…lol</li>
<li><span class="bold">Change it!!</span> Now, don’t freak out. I think that the person who can go cold turkey and change their entire life in one fail swoop is not the norm. Tackle ONE bad habit at a time. If you drink 3 Diet Cokes a day (I know there are no calories in a Diet Coke, but YOU know it is still bad for you….), then try to start by narrowing it down to ONE per day for the first week, then one every other day for the second week….then down to ONE on Friday. You will find you don’t miss it at all after you get rid of it. If you are going for the SCD lifestyle like me, there is an “ease in” process. Find out about it at <a href="http://scdlifestyle.com/about-the-scd-diet/" target="_blank">www.scdlifestlye.com</a></li>
<li><span class="bold">Do your best!</span> No one is perfect. We all face challenges, weakness, and chocolate chip cookies. If you slip up, or fail miserably, don’t beat yourself up. Just try again the next morning. And, then again the next morning….and so on until you actually make changes for the better. The road to an awesome life with good health is TOUGH in today’s society of quick, easy, processed foods.</li>
</ol>
<p>So.I am off to mix up a Vanilla Shakeology and do MY best to eat healthy today. To forgive myself for the cookies yesterday. To try to make the necessary changes I must adopt so I can get OFF these awful meds for Crohn’s. Time for me to REALLY Fight Like a Girl against Crohn’s. Good luck to you and comment below if you are ready to face YOUR Ugly Truth.</p>
