<p>I received the most wonderful testimony from one of the dedicated members of my 5:30AM Boot Camp about how fitness has helped her productivity at work:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>I had heard myths & legends that exercise not only helps your body, but also your mind.  As a full-time working mother  who had not routinely exercised in <span class="underline">years</span>, I was skeptical.   Looking for <span class="underline">physical</span> improvement, I reluctantly joined some neighborhood friends for Rachel Tipton’s bootcamp in May.  Rachel immediately recognized the strengths and weaknesses in our group, pushed us as far as she needed to, and after the first class and a few sore muscles I was ready for more.  That first month was intense; 5am wake-up’s, sore muscles, pushing myself.   It was not until the month-end sales meeting at work that I realized an even bigger result.  I had sold more homes the month of May than any other month of my sales career.... In over 6 years.  I absolutely attribute this to bootcamp.  As I worked on my <span class="underline">physical</span> improvement, the focus, energy level and discipline Rachel helped me find directly resulted in <span class="underline">mental</span> improvement.  A very tangible result!  I’m so thankful to Rachel for committing to me, and look forward to each class with her.  So.. myth busted!  Exercise absolutely helps your <span class="underline">body</span>, your <span class="underline">mind</span> and even your <span class="underline">spirit</span>!</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>THIS is why I love fitness so much. There is SO much more to it than just sweat and weight loss. It’s an entire lifestyle change that, with consistency over time, can alter the face of your business, relationships, and mindset. #ultrafitlifestyle</p>
