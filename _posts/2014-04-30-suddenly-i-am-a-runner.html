<p>It all started at Big Daddy’s Boot Camp. Out of the gate, Chief Big Daddy made me run 2 miles with the group. I told him I hate to run. He said, “You used to hate it.” And off I went.....</p>

<p>Three weeks later, I am addicted and registered for my first 1/2 marathon in January at the Walt Disney World Marathon Weekend. Go figure. I think about running constantly now. I am on a training schedule and on my off days, I think about my next run. Strange indeed....</p>

<p>I only run 2-3 miles mostly right now. I did a 5 mile run on Sunday and that actually went ok. Going for 5 again on Saturday. Next week, I am taking time to go to Mount Pleasant to get fitted for big girl running shoes.</p>

<p>I suppose if I am going to have an addiction, fitness and running aren’t the worst I could have! (Or have had!!)</p>
