<p>Yesterday, I spent $5.61 on a couple of things at the grocery store and $7.68 on a new book for Roxie. <span class="italic">(She earned that book!)</span> I think I did well keeping my spending in check. Today is another day to work towards my UltraFitFinances. <a href="http://www.ginaandcompany.com/" target="_blanl">A wise business coach</a> once told me this: <span class="bold italic">Money likes direction</span>. You must tell your money where to go. Literally!</p>
<!--more-->

<p>One of the main reasons for tracking spending is to create awareness of where my money is going. <span class="italic">Money likes direction</span>. When I am out there brainlessly spending on stuff I do not need at Target, my money is flowing out of my wallet or bank account like water. I have created awareness for myself so that I know exactly where every penny is going and if the spending is truly justified.</p>

<p>I have a white board in my office with all of my debts listed in order from smallest to largest. The <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/" target="_blank">Dave Ramsey</a> method tells me to focus on destroying <span class="italic">ONE</span> chunk of debt at a time. I will double up payments on the smallest debt until it is <span class="italic">GONE</span>. Then, move on to the next one, all the while maintaining minimum payments on the rest. One by one, I am going to watch them disappear. It will give me great pleasure to erase and rewrite the numbers as they diminish, until they are gone all together.</p>

<p>Now, there is a fun side to this money likes direction theory: <span class="italic">goal setting</span>. I am a huge believer in dreaming big. I have lived more than one situation when I put a dream or goal in writing and watched it come true. I keep my top 10 goals in a list on my phone. I look at it nearly every day and alter it as my priorities change or a goal is achieved. I learned this from one of my heroes, <a href="http://www.chalenejohnson.com/" target="_blank">Chalene Johnson</a>. In 2013, we found ourselves in a “one car family” situation. My husband was working in Myrtle Beach and I was working in Pawleys Island. It was tough making it work. This lasted about 6 months. After about 3 months, I made my #1 goal to read as follows: <span class="bold italic">I bought a Honda Fit</span>. <span class="italic">(note: write your goals as if you have already accomplished them.)</span> I found the exact make, model, and color I wanted. I looked at the Honda website every day and imagined myself driving the car. I was not sure how I would be able to afford it, but I had no doubt I would get it somehow.</p>

<p>I was still in real estate at the time. One Saturday, I was on floor duty at the office, answering every sales call that came in. I took a call from a couple who claimed they wanted to come down and look at an oceanfront condo the next weekend. I set the appointment, not really taking it too seriously, since the economy was still in the tank, and real estate is full of tire kickers. Lo and behold, that couple DID come down and look at the condo. As we left the oceanfront balcony, I casually asked, <span class="italic">“So, what do you think?”</span></p>

<div class="centered-text">
	<p><span class="italic">“Let’s go write a contract,”</span> the man said.</p>
</div>

<p>They bought the condo for $575,000 (a steal) for cash; we closed it in 10 days time. I deposited my commission and went to buy my Honda Fit the very next day.</p>

<p>I love telling this story, because it proves that writing down your dreams and goals helps them come true. I know exactly where my money is going to go in 2016. I have debts to pay off, <span class="italic">AND</span> I also have dreams that I am pursuing. Money likes direction. Not to say that unexpected expenses are not going to come up; they always do. However, I know what direction my money is headed.</p>

<p>Do <span class="italic">YOU</span> know where your money is headed? Take a few minutes today to dream big. Make a list of your top 10 goals. Don’t worry about how you will achieve it. The how works itself out. Figure out they WHAT <span class="italic">(What do you want?)</span> and more importantly, they WHY <span class="italic">(Why do you want it?)</span>. Write it down. Put it in a list on your phone. Or, better yet, make a vision board and put it on the wall in your office. Money likes direction, so tell your money where to go.</p>
