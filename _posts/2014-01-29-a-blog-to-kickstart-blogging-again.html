<p>I admit I am a slacker with blogging. Just getting real here: I am way too busy! I am trying to get a hold of it all so I can fit blogging back in my life. The only way is to just jump in and START. I may start using this blog as just a daily diary of the challenges and adventures it is to be a <a href="http://litchfield-dance.com/" target="_blank">dance teacher</a>, <a href="http://www.litchfieldrealestate.com/" target="_blank">Realtor®</a>, and <a href="http://www.beachbodycoach.com/ultrafitdancer" target="_blank">Beachbody Coach</a>. There’s plenty of adventure!!</p>

<p>For now, I wanted to share this:</p>

<p>I was just completing an assignment for a Beachbody Coach training group I am participating in, but I wanted to share with ya’ll the reasoning behind WHY I talk about Beachbody and working out SOOOO much all the time:</p>

<p>I joined TBB because I already had success getting fit with P90X after the birth of my daughter. P90X whipped me back into shape post-Roxie even faster than I thought possible. I found I was in even BETTER shape than before the baby! When I found out about the Coach opportunity, it made perfect sense for me to represent Beachbody. I got a bad start and did not connect with my Coach, so I quit. I thought the same thing a lot of people think: “This thing doesn’t work; it really IS as scam.” But, my current upline Coach found me still logging my workouts daily and stuck with me through the 6 month waiting period until I could re-sign.</p>

<p>I am happy I did re-sign up as a Coach because TBB has altered my entire life. Not only have I learned to control my Crohns without ANY medication and I earn an extra income doing what I love (workout and talk about working out!!!!), but I have watched my life improve in ALL areas. Thanks to the personal development aspect of the business, I am a better business woman in my other work as well. I have always loved positive, motivational quotes; I used to post them on my dorm room door long before Facebook existed! However, I did not know what personal development was and how it could miraculously change my life over time. AND, Beachbody programs have gotten me in better shape than I ever was my entire performance career as a dancer. The programs are perfectly put together for optimum results, and I never have to leave home to go to a gym!</p>

<p>Because of my Beachbody business, I hope to HELP more people who live with Crohns to feel better and live happier, healthier lives. I see and hear suffering all through the Crohns community and wish I could help others get where I am: able to live a happy and functional life WITH Crohns.Actually, I’d like to help ANYONE who does not believe they can lead a healthier life; we all have doubts and limitations!</p>

<p>I hope to gradually shift out of real estate and into a career that focuses only on fitness and dance by REPLACING my real estate income with TBB income. Others are doing it, so why not me?! Thanks to TBB I have learned to Dream BIG; I am no longer the person who thinks that success and “the good life” are not for the likes of me. I am busy working hard to BECOME and have and achieve the life I imagine and dream of every day. I know EXACTLY what that looks like; my goals and dreams are written out in a note on my phone. I know that working for someone else will never get me there. Working for myself, and working HARD will get me where I want to be......the Land of my DREAMS!!!!</p>
