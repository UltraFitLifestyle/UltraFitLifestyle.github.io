<p>70% of all home-based businesses succeed within the first three years compared to just 30% of regular businesses, <span class="bold italic">or 2.3 times the rate</span>. A big part of this equation is return on investment; while other businesses are sinking cost into overhead each month, home-based business owners are working right from home!</p>

<p>A survey conducted by businessforhome.org revealed that 70% of their survey respondents would prefer to be self-employed. Do you fall into this category? No matter where you live, self-employed workers get to be their own bosses and reap the rewards of their own hard work as well!</p>

<p>There are a plethora of advantages to owning your very own home-based business! Do you want to make a bit of money on the side, or quit your current job and make your home-based business a full time job? Owning your own home-based business gives you the opportunity to be your own boss, work from the comfort of your own home and to make money doing it!</p>

<p>Right Management recently released a survey stating that only 19% of workers in America and Canada are satisfied with their current jobs. Roughly two-thirds (65%) were either <span class="italic">somewhat unsatisfied</span> or <span class="italic">unsatisfied</span>. A survey by Mercer that polled 30,000 workers around the world found that 28% to 56% of employees want to leave their current jobs.</p>

<p class="bold">The Upside Potential Of A Home-Based Business</p>
<p>$427 billion a year is made in the United States alone with home-based businesses! In fact, one in five (20%) home-based businesses make $100,000 – $500,000 a year! Home-based businesses can be extremely lucrative for those that are willing to put in the time and effort, but they are also affordable too; 44% of home-based businesses are started for under $5,000, and many of those start-up costs and ongoing expenses are tax deductible!</p>
