In today’s fast paced world, we are always looking for a quick fix and instant results. While fitness and weight loss are two things that do not happen overnight, here are 3 ways you _CAN_ instantly improve your well being starting today:

1)	 **Stretch first thing in the morning**. Most people, even the UltraFit, generally place flexibility at the bottom of the priority when it comes to fitness. After a crushing our workout, drenched in sweat, we want to get to the shower and seek some calories, right? I know for myself, even though I am a dancer and know I need to stretch (especially when I am hot and sweaty, _BEST_![glassofwater.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/glassofwater.jpg)
 time to stretch), I neglect it sometimes, too. If you really want to feel 100% better than you did yesterday, start your day off with a stretching session. It does not have to be something super intricate. Start by pulling your knees to your chest before you get out of bed in the morning. Once you get out of bed, reach up, touch your toes, and roll up slowly through your spine. Repeat that a few times while your coffee brews. You will find that a good morning stretch will wake you up and get your blood flowing. You will find that you feel better all day long. When you do, start adding a few more stretches, and before you know it, you will have an entire morning yoga routine!

2)	 **Drink more water.** In the summer months, when the weather is hot, our bodies naturally crave more water. However, in the winter, when the heat is on inside, our bodies tend to get dehydrated as well. Take your body weight and divide it in half: that is the amount of water you should drink per day in ounces. If you are sweating and working out, you should drink more than that. Most people balk at that amount, thinking it is way too much. The fact is, that drinking more water is the most effective weight loss aid. Nine times out of ten, when we feel hungry or hangry, we are actually dehydrated. Drink a big glass of water before a meal, and you might also find that you are less likely to overeat. Try it today; drinking more water is an inexpensive, simple way to feel more alert, improve skin elasticity, and improve energy levels.


3)	 **Find a way to meditate.** Imagine that you woke up this morning, and immediately began doing bicep curls continuing that exercise all day long without a break. Your biceps would be fatigued to the point of screaming, right? Well, that’s what we do to our minds. Now, imagine your mind is a muscle. It gets worked harder than any other muscle all day long: planning, figuring out things, worrying, calculating, etc. Meditation scares most people, because they find it difficult to quiet the mind. The point is, that we _ALL_ have trouble with that. Meditation is a practice that takes practice. Simply put, you can start meditating by taking 5 minutes to focus on your breathing. Set a timer, sit quietly with eyes closed, and focus completely on the breath moving in and out of your body. Choose a word or simple phrase to repeat. When your mind starts to wander (and it will), gently bring your focus back to your breath and your mantra. When you make this a regular practice in your life, you will notice that you become calmer and more clear-headed. You are finally giving your mind a break for a few minutes, which is exactly what it needs so that you can function at peak performance.
