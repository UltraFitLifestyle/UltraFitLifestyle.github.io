<p class="bold centered-text">You have been hearing the hype, so……What is PiYo?</p>
<img width="300" height="126" src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/piyo2.jpg" />

<p class="centered-text">Carve an intensely defined physique-without jumps, without weights, and without joint strain. Using body weight, PiYo uses low-impact, high-intensity movements inspired by Pilates and yoga. The result? Long, lean, muscles, a high, firm booty, and tight, flat, sexy abs. PiYo will work every single muscle to stabilize, stretch, and strengthen every inch of a body. And since Chalene Johnson cranked up the speed and the fun, crazy calories will be burned too!</p>
