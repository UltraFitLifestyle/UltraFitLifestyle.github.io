<p>I have been an active gal since my early days. I started dance when I was 5 and throughout my amazingly fun performance career, I always had some outside activities to keep fit. Whether it was intense ballet class, yoga, pilates, or hitting the gym, I kept some sort of program going that helped keep me fit. There is just something about fitness that makes me happy...not just the endorphins, but also the entire atmosphere of personal and physical development and constant improvement.</p>

<p>During the “hey day” of my dance career, I was more focused on being “skinny” than being fit and healthy. Yes, I struggled with eating disorders and low self-esteem. I was all about cardio, cardio, cardio! For some reason, it did not occur to me that what I was feeding my body was holding me back. I am still learning that. Out of the wreckage of those years, I emerged through <span class="italic">FITNESS</span> and began to be excited about my improved health and acceptance of myself as a beautiful and unique person-in-progress.</p>

<p>In the Spring 2010, I caught a flu virus and was very sick for about a week. My appetite took another week to come around, but I never really felt BETTER. By Summer, I was passing a noticeable amount of blood and knew something was wrong. I tried to be tough and justify the pain and the blood (yes, I know..). Finally, I went to a gastroenterologist. He fast-tracked me to a colonoscopy and subsequently diagnosed me with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease" target="_blank">Crohn’s disease</a>.</p>

<p>You know that feeling when you reach the top of the big hill on the roller coaster and begin the free-fall? Well, that’s what happened next in my health. My gastro put me on prednisone, which aggravated my situation and landed me in the hospital for a week. Next, I became a guinea pig for treatment drugs. Remicade was the one we settled on, which is administered via IV and has terrible side effects. Yuck, right? Shortly thereafter, we added Imuran in daily pill form.</p>

<p>Here’s me and my family at Pawleys Island beach in 2010 at the height of my illness...I finally left vacation to go to the doctor. Check out my swollen abdomen...ouch!</p>

<p>I felt yucky all of the time and had little to no energy. I had a great deal of trouble keeping up with my toddler. I missed my old, vivacious self. So, I decided to take a more proactive approach. I looked into alternative methods of dealing with Crohn’s disease and found the <a href="http://scdlifestyle.com/about-the-scd-diet/" target="_blank">Specific Carb Diet</a>.  The diet is taylor-made to keep intestinal disorders at bay. I tried it through the holidays and it was so limited, it made me MORE miserable. I also did not see any major changes in my health, probably because it was so difficult to really stick to it.</p>

<p>By the Spring of 2011, I had had enough. I began a strict regimen of healthy eating, experimenting with things that I could and could not tolerate. I had read that exercise was beneficial to Crohn’s patients, so I pulled out my P90X DVDs. I had first purchased the P90X program in 2008 to get back into shape after the birth of my daughter.</p>

<p>I struggled through the workouts, but I found that the more I moved my body, the better I felt. I <span class="bold">kept pushing play</span>, and got stronger and stronger. I was amazed. As I became more and more fit, <a href="http://www.thecompoundeffect.com/" target="_blank">The Compound Effect</a> came into play and everything snowballed.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the present day. I added <a href="http://racheltipton.com/shakeology/" target="_blank">Shakeology</a> to my nutrition plan, and it has really smoothed out my digestion. Thanks to P90X, I was ready and able to say “YES” when <a href="http://www.legendsinconcert.com/" target="_blank">Legends in Concert</a> called me last Summer and asked me to come on board again as a singer/dancer. If I had not taken an assertive approach to my health and fitness, I would probably not have been able to handle the performances physically.</p>

<p>The opposite is true: I workout daily with a Beachbody program (I have completed <span class="bold">Insanity, P90X, Body Gospel, Brazil Butt Lift,</span> and <span class="bold">TurboFire</span>...so far! Currently on TurboFire one more time!!), although I am no longer pulling the 6 days per week of shows at Legends, I DO teach dance at <a href="http://litchfield-dance.com/" target="_blank">Litchfield Dance Arts Academy</a> 5-6 days a week, I work my day job at <a href="http://litchfieldrealestate.com/" target="_blank">Litchfield Real Estate</a>, and chase my daughter around...and I FEEL fantastic! I do not drink alcohol, I rarely touch dairy, and I sorta basically follow the SCD Diet. I am OFF Imuran and hoping to get off Remicade!!! I have crazy energy and people ask me how I do it all....I reply <span class="bold italic">BEACHBODY</span> helps me do it all! From fitness, to nutrition, to time management and personal development...I can thank Beachbody for getting my life back in order.</p>
