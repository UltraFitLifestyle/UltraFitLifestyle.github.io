<p>I was in for a shock when I moved my daughter from private school to public school on my very first morning drop off. The handful of cars dropping off at the <a href="http://www.pawleysislandmontessori.org/" target="_blank">Montessori school</a> were literally child’s play in comparison with the intensely organized chaos of <a href="http://www.wes.gcsd.k12.sc.us/" target="_blank">Waccamaw Elementary School</a> morning rush. I was grateful for the obviously skilled Lady Traffic Cop directing cars in and out of the drop off line.</p>

<p>To observe this Lady Traffic Cop is like watching a dance. She has specific movements and placement for each direction of traffic. It may seem mundane to some. To me, she has <span class="italic">finesse</span>. It hit me one morning last week, when she was absent. There was a man in her place that day. He was not doing a <span class="italic">bad</span> job keeping the parents and their cars flowing. He simply did not have the pizzazz of the Lady Traffic Cop.</p>

<p>That day, when the sub cop was there, I was able to appreciate the Lady Traffic Cop as an important part of my morning. I enjoy seeing her. Even more, I saw how important she is to everyone’s morning! She is truly courageous to take on that job in the first place. She places herself in the midst of SUV-driving, bleary-eyed parents, half paying attention as they text and talk to their kids in the back seat!</p>

<p>What is notable about the graceful Lady Traffic Cop, is that she truly <span class="italic">cares</span> about what she does. I can tell by her purposeful walk and deliberate hand signals. She is not simply going through the motions. She shines with confidence, skill, and even makes her position fashion conscious with her bright colored shoes matching her safety vest!</p>

<p>To some, the Lady Traffic Cop might be just another face they pass each day. I find her to be symbolic of how one person can take a seemingly simple job and create a form of art that affects others.</p>

<p>Anyone know her name??</p>
