I have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease" target="_blank">Crohn’s disease</a> (but it doesn’t have me!!). So, along with my medications, I follow the <a href="http://scdlifestyle.com/about-the-scd-diet/" target="_blank">SCD Diet</a> as closely as posssible as it has been proven to help those with Crohn’s, IBD, Colitis, and even Autism! It is pretty restrictive, but the alternatives of pain, nausea, hospitalization, and surgery are much worse than giving up pizza! Fortunately, I LOVE a lot of the foods on the <a href="http://www.breakingtheviciouscycle.info/legal/listing/" target="_blank">SCD “Legal” foods list</a>. Here’s my FAV breakfast or anytime meal that everyone can enjoy.

<p class="bold">SCD Fruit Salad</p>

<p>– 1 mango</p>

<p>– 1/4 papaya</p>

<p>- 1/2 avocado</p>

<p>– small handful walnut pieces (4-5)</p>

<p>- 1 TBSP coconut oil</p>

<p>– 1 mint leaf</p>

<p>SOOOO easy: Cube the fruit and place in a bowl. Toss the walnut pieces in with the fruit. Heat the coconut oil on very low heat for about 2-3 mins and stir the mint leaf around in it to soak up flavor then pour over the fruit. ENJOY!</p>

<p class="italic">(Sorry I don’t have a picture of the finished product….I ate it up with such excitement, I forgot a pic!! NOM!!)</p>

<p>It may sound a bit weird at first but I assure you it is delicious!! And even more exciting is the complete nutrition you find in this recipe. Let’s consider the health benefits of each ingredient:</p>

<p><span class="bold">Coconut Oil:</span> This IS a fat, so you must use it in moderation, but the SCD diet is quite limited in fats, so “good” fats are welcome. Coconut oil has a blend of fatty acids that are considered “heart friendly,” known as myristic. Coconut oil is said to help the body’s resistance to certain viruses, bacteria, yeast, fungus, and candida.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Mango:</span> One of the great antioxidants, and one of my favorite foods!! When I was pregnant, I ate every mango I could find!! These tasty fruits are said to lower cholesterol, normalize insulin levels, helps alkalinize the body, and clear up acne prone skin. Mangoes also contain enzymes for breaking down proteins, so eating them can improve digestion. They are full of Vitamin A (good for eyesight), Vitamin C and A (immune boosters), and Vitamin E (for improved sex life??!!).</p>

<p><span class="bold">Papaya:</span> Also chock full of Vitamins A and E, papaya also boasts lots of Vitamin C (antioxidant, antihistamine). Rich in folic acid, papaya is said to help protect against heart disease and also promote digestive health and immune support. You see the trend here in this recipe for ingredients that promote digestion and give an immune boost; super important to us “Crohnies.”  Papayas also contain the digestive enzymes papain and chymopapain, known to lower inflammation in the body.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Avocado:</span> Avocados are another “fatty” food that sometimes gets a bad rap. If you are not eating a diet full of the “bad” fats, you are good to go with avocado! They contain a ton of carotenoid antioxidants that help lower the risk of heart disease and cancer and boost the immune system. They are also a natural anti-inflammatory in the form of phytosterols (a type of fat found in avocados). Another interesting thing found in avocado is oleic acid, which helps the digestive tract run smoothly.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Walnuts:</span> A great source of Vitamin E and rich in those wonderful Omega-3 fatty acids. Also know for antioxidant qualities as well as anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>

<p>So, if the health benefits of this recipe don’t grab you, the taste will. Yummy Yum Yum!!!</p>

<p><span class="bold italic">Tip on buying these fruits:</span> Mango, papaya, and avocado are best when just a little bit mushy when squeezed. Press gently at the stem of the fruit and if it gives a bit, you are good to go. If it is still firm, let it sit another day and re-check.</p>

<p class="italic centered-text">Wishing you health and happiness!!</p>
