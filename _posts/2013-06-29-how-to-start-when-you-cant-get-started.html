<p>The start is the hardest part, whether it be painting the bathroom, writing an essay, or beginning a new workout regime. It is especially tricky to get someone started on a workout that has never worked out before or it’s been a really long time. Once you get going, it is usually fine…..but <span class="italic">UGH</span> that initial push to START! So what do you do? <span class="italic">HOW</span> can you make it easier to get started?</p>

<p>Think of it like pushing a giant boulder down a hill. It takes a whole lot of effort to get that thing going, but once it is in motion, you really don’t have to do a thing except maybe give it a little help if it gets hung up on the way down. Same thing with getting going on your workouts. If you really are ready to get started, but keep putting it off, try these few tips:</p>

 <ul>
<li><span class="bold">Schedule it!</span> Write it down in your calendar, or schedule it in your Smartphone with an alert. Pretend it is an important client meeting or doctor’s appointment or whatever you need to tell yourself so that you WILL NOT compromise. You wouldn’t be late for a meeting with your boss, now would you?? Exactly. So, put it in your schedule and don’t allow anything to get in your way.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Share it!</span> Tell your Mom, your spouse, your best friend….heck tell ALL of them and more about how and when you are going to get started. Be specific. You want them to ask you how it went. The guilt of having to say you did not actually succeed might be enough to get you going. Or, you can use them as your support system, cheerleading squad, and shoulder to whimper on when you are sore afterwards!!</li>
<li><span class="bold">Enjoy it!!</span> Just because fitness tends to lean towards sweat and suffering and the whole “no pain, no gain” thing doesn’t mean it has to feel like a horrible awful obligation or death sentence. Be sure you find a program or activity that you enjoy so you will stick with it. Have <span class="italic">FUN</span> with it!!! Invite your best pal to join you. Keep in mind <span class="italic">WHY</span> you want to get fit, get lean, or get healthy.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Track it!</span> Buy yourself a dedicated fitness journal to document your journey. You will be proud of yourself once you do get started, so be sure to take “before” pictures and take measurements. No one has to see it, but you will want to know where you started once you get going. If you don’t write down your start weight, how will you know the amount you have lost?? Progress pictures are amazing to compare. Trust me, don’t sip this part. And, if you write down how you FEEL as you progress, you will notice that you are getting stronger and stronger!!</li>
</ul>

<p>You can DO this, just keep telling yourself that. There WILL be that little voice in your head that says, “Don’t bother,” and “I’m tired,” and “I don’t wanna,” and the worst of all: “This isn’t working!!” <span class="italic">Do not listen to that voice!!!</span></p>

<p>Just keep going…..once you stop or give up, you will have to start all over.</p>

<p class="bold centered-text">And the start is the hardest part!!!</p>
