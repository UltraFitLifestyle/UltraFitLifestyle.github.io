<p>I am a bit bummed that I have had to sit out of my workouts these last few days due to a very painful shoulder and neck injury. I overdid it in a dance class and ouchy!!! So, it has been bed rest for me. It is tough for me to sit still, but I am not simply vegging out the whole time.</p>

<p>I was put on muscle relaxers, a heating pad, and pain medication, which make me sleep a lot. But, when I am not sleeping, I am still working on self-improvement. I have started reading “The Total Money Makeover” by Dave Ramsey, so that I might get a real handle on my finances. Also, I committed to getting my FNS (Fitness Nutrition Specialist) and YES (Youth Exercise Specialist) certifications to accompany my <a href="http://www.nasm.org/" target="_blank">NASM</a> CPT (Certified Personal Trainer) credentials. I believe that in ANY situation, I can still grow.</p>

<p>If I am stuck in bed, I can still read and improve upon myself. It might just be a blessing that I am forced to slow down and smell the roses. My workouts will still be there when I am better. And, I can still support my Challenge Group even though I am out for the count.</p>

<p>My point here, is no matter what the circumstances, keep growing, never give up on improving your mind and body. It is a lifelong journey, not just a temporary diet and exercise plan!!</p>
