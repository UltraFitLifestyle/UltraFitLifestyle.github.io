<p>The last two weeks have been bananas crazy. I completely fell of the UltraFitFinancial wagon. Tracking my spending consisted of piling up my receipts on the counter. The good news is this: whether you fall of the financial or fitness wagon, you can chose to jump back on at any time.</p>

<p>The air has cleared after getting the show up at <a href="http://www.legendsinconcert.com/" target="_blank">Legends in Concert</a> and filming the bulk of videos for my UltraFitLifestyle series. I had some room to breathe this morning and sifted through the pile of receipts. It did not even take me that long. It was not so bad. What I DID notice is that I spent a lot of money eating out over the last two weeks. I “ran out of time” to go to the grocery store properly and never had any food in the house. Consequently, I spent a lot more money than I should have on outside snacks and meals.</p>

<p>I am back on the wagon again! I still have the same goals and simply have to get back to being more focused. Falling off the wagon happens quite often this time of year for everyone’s New Year’s Resolutions. It’s nearing the end of February and some people are running out of steam and skipping the gym.</p>

<p>I urge YOU to revisit your goals. <span class="bold italic">WHY</span> are you trying to reach them? Try rewriting your goals and keeping them in a list on your phone so you can look at them often. Go ahead and get back on the wagon, even if it was a terrible last two weeks. The game clock is still ticking and you <span class="bold">CAN</span> achieve what you desire!</p>
