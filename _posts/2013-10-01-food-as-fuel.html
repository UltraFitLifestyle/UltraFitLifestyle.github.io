<p>I am enjoying studying nutrition for my FNS (Fitness Nutrition Specialist certification) through NASM. I find it is helpful to me as I learn to eat better for my Crohn’s. And, I am slowly educating my dancers about using food as fuel rather than blindly grabbing what is in front of them before heading to my dance class!!</p>

<p>It seems that people’s food choices are rarely based on using food as fuel. More likely, we grab something out of convenience or habit. Even stronger are our emotional attachments to food, based on our culture and upbringing. True for me; my Mom’s holiday time stuffing is my all-time favorite comfort food. According to NASM’s course on nutrition, habits pertaining to food are the LAST thing to change for someone who moves to the United States from some other country. They can walk, talk, and act like a full-fledged, born-and-bred, but they will likely serve a traditional cultural meal from their home country come holiday time!</p>

<p>We also choose foods for taste and texture over true health value. I feel that; I LOVE Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups!!! However, we all know those are only ok in moderation. (That is one reason I am so hooked on <a href="http://racheltipton.com/shakeology/" target="_blank">Chocolate Vegan Shakeology</a>!!! I make it taste like PB Cups!) It takes a truly strong person to say, “Yep, I ADORE the taste of spinach….”</p>

<p>I definitely think we all deserve to enjoy our favorite comfort foods and cheat foods. The problem is when a person chooses the cheat the majority of the time. Think about your foods choices today. Did you actually consider which item on the menu would fulfill the most items on the nutritional chart? You are probably like me, and you think, <span class="italic">“Oh….that sounds GOOD!”</span></p>

<p>It is nearly impossible to change all your habits at one sitting. Try changing your way of thinking and letting go of one bad habit at a time. Is Diet Coke what you go to to get your afternoon energy? A Snickers bar? Wouldn’t an apple be a better choice? They say only one a day keeps the doctor away…..</p>

<p>If you give your body the nutrients it desires, you will be less hungry AND have more energy. Imagine that??!!!</p>
