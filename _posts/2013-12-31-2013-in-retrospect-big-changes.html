<p>Once Christmas hits and all is calm, I enjoy sitting by the glow of the Christmas tree (which I like to leave up as long as possible) and reflecting on the past year. 2013 was full of ups and downs and incredible growth for me. I can hardly believe the complete turnaround from where I was this time last year. From a one car family looking at possible foreclosure to a brand new car and starting renovations on our house! From a “sick” person with Crohn’s disease to a health conscious Crohn’s warrior, free of all meds!! How did I do it? Read on….</p>

<p>At the end of 2012, I found myself back on the stage at Legends in Concert. I had been asked to fill in for a few months as a singer/dancer. That went into a few more months and then I was offered the 2013 contract. Both my husband and I were performing in the show, and it was tough leaving Roxie with someone every night, but I agreed to the 2013 contract thinking we could reduce some debts. Things looked pretty good for 2013, although we were in a position where we had to draw unemployment for the month of January (when the show goes dark each year) in order to make ends meet. We went away for a few days, as January is the only time off Legends in Concert has each year. Things were tight, but we felt like we could squeak by since we had contracts for the next 11 months. I also had a colonoscopy done by my GI, since I assumed I would not be free for a procedure like that in the next 11 months. Results came back best case scenario, but a large medical bill accompanied as well as my regular $9000/per treatment every 8 weeks.</p>

<p>Day 1 of rehearsal for Legends arrived and I got a call to stop by the office before heading to the rehearsal studio. The company had to make some budget cuts and the singer/dancers were being cut from the show. <span class="italic">I was suddenly out of a job!</span> It was a real shocker. I was still a <a href="http://www.litchfieldrealestate.com/" target="_blank">Realtor</a> and also a <a href="http://www.beachbodycoach.com/ultrafitdancer" target="_blank">Beachbody Coach</a>, but neither was making me a steady enough income at the time to support my side of things in our family budget.</p>

<p>The next few weeks were a blur of anger, resentment, confusion, and worry.  We had not planned for this surprise and our finances plummeted quickly into turmoil. After a couple of months, we were behind on our mortgage and feared looming foreclosure. Since I am in real estate, I saw the picture for what it was. Then, something snapped in me and I decided I would <span class="italic">NOT</span> be dragged under by all of this….I put on my boxing gloves!!!</p>

<p>I had called Ilka at <a href="http://litchfield-dance.com/" target="_blank">Litchfield Dance Arts Academy</a> and asked for work. She brought me on as a sub at first, and gradually added me on as main teacher of some classes. I put my nose to the grindstone and buckled down to truly build my business in Beachbody and also work harder at real estate. I knew that I would never make it if I let the anger and bitterness rule me, so I put a <span class="italic">LOT</span> of focus on personal development so I could maintain a level-headed outlook on things.</p>

<p>I got busy looking for ways to keep our house and found a wonderful program through SC Help. I had to fill out an incredible amount of paperwork, and jumped through a hundred hoops. But, at the end of it all, we received assistance that caught us up and got us back on our feet. I was and am so very grateful for the kind people that helped us through that process. It was a very humbling experience.</p>

<p>All of the personal development I was studying got me into a seriously structured daily routine. It was around this time that I became religious about my 5:00AM workouts. The early start to my day also allowed time for me to dedicate to my Beachbody business EVERY day before everything else got rolling. Although tough at first, I have come to cherish my quiet early mornings. I also developed an attitude of going above and beyond in all things. As I learned to give more and do more, I felt my energy grow.</p>

<p>As far as my Crohn’s management, I decided I was getting myself off of the crazy expensive meds the my doctor had me on that came with awful side effects. I gave up all alcohol, dairy, coffee, and adopted a very conscious way of eating. I would rather be healthy and free of meds than indulge in things I don’t really need, but kind of want in the moment. I rarely miss my <a href="http://www.racheltipton.com/shakeology/" target="_blank">Shakeology</a>; I am convinced that getting that daily dose of dense nutrition in me has a positive effect on my overall health. I make no crazy medical claims here, just simply that I see my health decline when I don’t drink it consistently. And, to be clear, I DO still have “crappy” Crohn’s days, just a lot fewer!!</p>

<p>I meditate daily to keep my stress level under control. I tend to get hot under the collar, so have to struggle to keep it in check. I never thought I could meditate 15 mins per day, because at first only 5 mins seemed impossible. With consistency, I am able to sit still for 15 mins and even wish for more when the timer chimes. My mind still races, but it is helpful to maintain those quiet moments to calm it down.</p>

<p>I am also a huge believer in writing down my goals. I have a chalkboard wall right as you enter my house and it always has something motivational written on it. It currently reads: “DREAM BIG in 2014!” in huge letters. <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> I have a list of Top 10 goals that I keep on my iPhone. I look at it often and re-evaluate it every 2 weeks. Sometimes, it changes. But, most of the goals are the same until I reach them and then replace them. My goals list is like my road map. No matter what happens, what someone says or does, or what obstacles come up (and they ALWAYS come up!!), I am not swayed far from my path towards my goals. Setbacks only slow me down momentarily, and disappointments only send me back to my list to re-evaluate again.</p>

<p>My #1 goal for a lot of 2013 was the blue raspberry Honda Fit that I drive right now. When I put that car on my list, I did not know exactly how I would get it. I just knew we needed a 2nd car and I wanted that one! (Cause I am Fit…haha) I kept my nose to the grindstone and sure enough, by August, I made a big oceanfront sale and bought that car!!! Great moment. So, new #1 goal was made….</p>

<p>I find that a lot of people I talk to feel “trapped” in their situation. They have a hard time figuring out HOW to change their life for the better. I used to feel that way, too. But, I have found that figuring out <span class="italic">WHAT</span> your dreams are and <span class="italic">WHY</span> you want that in your life are the only way to start. Just go buy a journal and write down your goals and dreams. Go BIG!! Write down the great, big, giant, hairy, scary, seemingly unattainable dream of how you wish your life could be. Then, you know where you are headed. Think of it as a trip: once you have decided if you are headed to San Fransisco or New York City, then you just have to figure out the method to get there. You will never get <span class="italic">ANYWHERE</span> if you don’t decide where you are going!!</p>

<p>You <span class="italic">CAN</span> change your life. But, you must decide that you are in charge. Then, you must to commit to the hard work involved (cause change doesn’t always come easy). And, then, you are already on your way to success.</p>

<p>I am a lot of things (Mom, wife, Realtor, dance teacher, aerial arts enthusiast, and fitness Coach), but what I really love is helping people make positive changes in their lives. So, PLEASE contact me if you need some help. I can help you get on the right path to health ad fitness, better nutrition, better time management, and even better money management. I learned a great deal about these things in 2013. Don’t be afraid to let me help you, and SHOW you how I have made these amazing changes in my life.</p>
