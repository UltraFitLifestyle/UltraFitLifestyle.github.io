<p>I have always been a vanilla girl. I only really like vanilla ice cream and vanilla cake with vanilla icing! (But, not often on the cake, and never on the ice cream, since I donâ€™t tolerate dairy anymore....lol). I have asked since I became a Coach with Beachbody <span class="italic">WHEN</span> we would get Vanilla. I always got the same answer: <span class="bold italic">NEVER!</span></p>

<p>Well....never say never, because it is now available!!!!!!! Click <a href="https://extranet.securefreedom.com/MillionDollarBody/csShopping/ShoppingCart_Detail.asp?PriceID=78723&Cat=Nutrition%20and%20Supplements|Best%20Sellers&AddToCart=" target="_blank">HERE</a> to order yours now.</p>

<p>I am seriously doing a dance of joy, because I cannot wait to try it! Check out the latest video, explaining WHY Beachbody never offered Vanilla Shakeology before, and HOW they figured out to give us what we wanted!!!! Yippee!</p>
