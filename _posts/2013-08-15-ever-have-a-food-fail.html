<p>I think the image says it all….LOL! So, I had a food fail the other night. We have all been there: going along, minding our own business, eating clean, exercising, feeling great…..then BOOM! Grandma shows up with homemade spaghetti and garlic bread (the kind that they must soak overnight in butter…..argh!).  Tired from a long day and hungry…..I went for it.</p>

<p>Fail.

<p>It happens. For me, a slip like that is extra bad, because eating certain foods will cause my Crohn’s disease to turn into an ugly internal beast. But, my own fault!!</p>

<p>Everyone has a food fail once in a while…..or more. The key is not to beat yourself up. Just get back on the wagon of clean eating right away. And, try to be better prepared the next time. Carry healthy snacks with you so you never reach that “desperate” kind of hungry.</p>

<p>Health and fitness are both an ongoing process. Don’t get caught up in one moment in time. Keep perspective on the overall picture and KEEP GOING!!!</p>
