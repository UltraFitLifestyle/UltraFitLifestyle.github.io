<p>This morning, as I looked through my wallet searching for receipts, I was thrilled to discover that I spent $0.00 yesterday! The fact that I made money rather than spent it is good. The fact that I was not actually aware of it shows that I still have work to do on achieving UltraFitFinances. The celebration here is that I am making baby steps in the right direction; the direction of getting my debt under control and my finances in order.</p>

<p>I saw the greatest quote in my <a href="http://www.passionplanner.com/" target="_blank">Passion Planner</a> (awesome day planner and time management tool!) yesterday. It is a Chinese proverb that says: <span class="bold italic">The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones.</span> I may be starting out small, but at least I have started. Momentum is slowly building.  <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/" target="_blank">Dave Ramsey</a> has a list of baby steps to getting out of debt. I started <span class="italic">thinking</span> about doing this a year ago. Now, I am finally following the program. It is slow, but I am seeing results already: I have cash in my pocket, I have all my bills paid, I am building my emergency fund (Dave recommends a $1000 stash for emergencies), and today I doubled up payment on my smallest debt.</p>

<p>Momentum is built slowly. I was listening to <a href="http://www.darrenhardy.com/" target="_blank">Darren Hardy</a> this week, and he described momentum with the illustration of a locomotive: It takes a lot of effort to get the locomotive moving at first. But, once it is rolling, it can blast through a steel enforced concrete wall and keep on going. Momentum can’t be stopped! However, it takes consistency to build momentum.</p>

<p>So, whether you are with me on crushing debt this year by getting your finances under control or you are focusing on controlling your eating habits, <span class="italic">STICK WITH IT</span>. If you started that new fitness and nutrition program on January 1st, and you have kept your focus, you should be seeing small results by now. Like me, nothing drastic has happened, but perhaps a few tiny wins. Keep repeating the positive behaviors day in and day out, even when you don’t want to, and momentum will take over soon enough. That’s when those baby steps will turn into giant leaps of progress. You <span class="bold">GOT</span> this!!</p>
