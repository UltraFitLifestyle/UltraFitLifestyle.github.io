<p>I don’t believe that there are coincidences. When something seems like a coincidence, I <span class="italic">KNOW</span> God has a hand in it and I am on the lookout for the lesson. Early this morning, lying in bed, I was thinking about this commitment to blogging on my financial fitness for 2016. I was thinking, <span class="italic">“Maybe I shouldn’t have started this thing. What the heck do I have to blog about? Will anyone really care about the fact that I managed to spend only $14.67 yesterday?”</span></p>

<p>And, then, God served up a “coincidence!”</p>

<p>I LOVE my church, <a href="http://www.newspring.cc/" target="_blank">Newspring Church</a>. I am so grateful for the miraculous changes I have experienced in my life since my friend and business Coach, <a href="http://www.ginaandcompany.com/" target="_blank">Gina</a>, invited me. Today, I was kind of disappointed that <a href="http://www.perrynoble.com/" target="_blank">Perry Noble</a> was not present to deliver the message. Boy, was in for a big surprise when <a href="http://www.chrishogan360.com/" target="_blank">Chris Hogan</a> hit the stage.</p>

<p>Chris Hogan is a part of <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/" target="_blank">Dave Ramsey’s</a> organization. As I mentioned in my <a href="{{page.previous.url}}" target="_blank">first UltraFitFinances blog post</a>, I started Dave Ramsey’s envelope system at the end of 2015. I have begun my emergency fund. I have my plan set up for 2016 so that I can conquer my debt. So, is it a coincidence that Newspring had Mr. Logan speak to me today? I doubt it.</p>

<p>The biggest takeaway is that some of us, myself included, have a pronoun problem. I get concerned with what is happening with <span class="bold">MY</span> money. When the real deal is that it really is not my money after all. Nothing that I have would be there for me if God had not provided it for me. It’s <span class="bold">HIS</span> money, not mine. My talents and gifts are all given to me by God. And, He wishes for me to open up those gifts fully and GIVE them away to others. Stopping to listen for God’s will for me AND for my money will lead me to the success promised in Jeremiah 29:11.</p>

<p><span class="underline">Here are a couple of zingers Mr. Hogan laid on us today:</span></p>

<p>1) <span class="bold">You are either getting better or getting worse.</span> Be sure you are working every day towards improving your life or it will simply and slowly deteriorate. Beware of mind-sucking people and activities that cause you stress, anger, sloth, or despair. Seek instead the things that have a positive impact on you and build up OTHERS so that you can grow.</p>

<p>2) <span class="bold">Old hurt can do new harm. LET IT GO!</span> I am definitely guilty of holding on to resentments. I struggle daily to forgive and forget. Truth is that the person against whom we hold that grudge does not know and likely does not care. We are only hurting ourselves and causing new hurt today when we replay past incidents over in our heads.</p>

<p>3) <span class="bold">Your bitterness can keep you from your better-ness.</span> In line with the previous comment, we prevent our progress by dwelling in the past.</p>

<p>4) <span class="bold">Winners don’t whine.</span> I might have to put this in bold letters on the wall in front of my desk. Winners put their heads down and do what is required to make it happen. Usually, this work includes a great deal of time committed to doing things they would really rather NOT do. But, winners know that the payoff for hard work is huge. I am going to remember this as my tough year progresses.</p>

<p>5) <span class="bold">It’s hard to be hateful when you are grateful.</span> I have made a habit of beginning and ending each day acknowledging several things for which I am grateful. It helps me stay away from the fears and worries that are a constant threat to my focus and progress.</p>

<p>6) <span class="bold">Are you doing what is comfortable or what is effective?</span> Mr. Hogan used his message to suggest that we get out of our comfort zones and invite people who we believe are far from God to come to church. Stepping out of our comfort zone may not be the easy thing to do. Most times, when we step out towards the scary world of improving our life or the lives of others, it is always worth it. It is certainly more effective than inactivity or staying the same. I know my focus on my finances in 2016 will be uncomfortable. I DO believe that my actions will be effective. After all, Dave Ramsey’s methods have gotten thousands of people out of debt.</p>
