<p><img src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/mt-lake.jpg" width="150" height="150" />I love a good road  trip. It always helps me clear my head and get some perspective on my life.  I have been struggling with a few decisions lately, and was glad to have a road trip over the weekend to think it all through. Having great girlfriends to bounce ideas off of helped! I have a few tips on how I make difficult decisions, in case you are struggling with something yourself.</p>

<p><span class="bold">1) Don’t make an emotional decision.</span> If you are emotional about something that upset you, try not to have a knee jerk response. Wait until the emotions cool before doing <span class="italic">anything</span>. Crunch the numbers. Numbers never lie. Look at the facts.</p>

<p><span class="bold">2) Weigh the pros and cons.</span> Figure out the upside and downside to making the decision one way or the other. Actually take out a piece of paper and write it down if possible, so the pros ad cons are clearly laid out in front of you. It is important to take a look at everything you stand to lose in making a decision. And, more importantly, what you stand to gain.</p>

<p><span class="bold">3) Go with your gut.</span> If you take some quiet time, and listen to our gut intuition, you already <span class="italic">know</span> the answer. You know what will make you happy and what is in line with your goals and dreams. Meditate on it and listen to your inner voice. See yourself in the success of making the decision. You’ll know when the answer is right for you.</p>

<p>Good luck friends!</p>
