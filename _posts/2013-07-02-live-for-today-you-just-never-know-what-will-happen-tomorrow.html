<p>Out of the blue yesterday, I heard about a friend of mine being rushed to the hospital due to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm" target="_blank">brain aneurysm</a>. Serious stuff. She is OK so far, but I have been very emotional all day. It made me realize once again how fragile life is, and how we take it for granted each day. Mostly, we all go about our day and text while driving, eat terrible stuff, yell at our kids, get mad at our husbands ( I KNOW I am not alone here....) and don’t think too hard about how quickly and easily our loved ones could be taken from us.</p>

<p>Enough of the heavy stuff, let’s bring this down to a practical level here. Do you have a <span class="italic">BIG</span> dream for your life that you feel is out of your reach? Do you have things left undone and unsaid that you “will get to one day”? I am not talking about taking down the wall paper in the bathroom. I mean traveling to Paris, getting started on a new career, asking her to marry you....!!!!</p>

<p class="bold italic centered-text">So......what are you waiting for????</p>

<p>The clock is ticking and you aren’t getting any younger and you NEVER know what might happen tomorrow. I don’t want you to think doomsday either. Tomorrow might bring you that amazing opportunity about which you have always dreamed. Will you be ready? Or, what if you asked her to marry you and she replies, “Yes.....what took you so long??</p>

<p>Another friend of mine wrote an inspiring blog about hesitating when faced with your future. You can read it <a href="http://www.edenleefitness.com/2013/07/02/look-to-the-future/" target="_blank">HERE</a>. My question is this: is that fear or worry holding you back from taking that first step <span class="italic">REALLY</span> worth it? Fear can be crippling; but it is usually not worth it. Consider this acronym: FEAR = false evidence appearing real. So, most of what we fear is not actually real, but conjured up in our minds. So, why not try what you are afraid to do and find out??</p>

<p>There are a ton of different ways to say it: Carpe Diem, Seize the Day, Live like you are Dying....and so on. It is in fact true. What IF it were your last day? Would you do things differently today? Or, if it was the last day for someone you love? Would you be sure to tell that person you love them? <span class="italic">OF COURSE!!</span></p>

<p>So, think about your big goals and dreams. Think about those people you care about the most. What can you do TODAY to make your life more true to your dreams and worthy of those you love? It could be a small subtle change in how you do things each day, or a huge change in the course of your life.</p>

<p>Whatever it is, don’t hold back. You just never know what tomorrow will bring. Be bold.Have faith. Go big, or go home!!</p>
