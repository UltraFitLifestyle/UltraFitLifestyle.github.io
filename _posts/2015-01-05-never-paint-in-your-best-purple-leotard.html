<p><img class="left" width="150" height="150" src="{{site.url}}/images/2015/purple-leotard2.jpg" />When we first moved into our house in Pawleys Island, there was carpet in the bathrooms. Yuck! Who does that? There was awful, peeling, poorly installed wallpaper in Roxie’s bathroom that also needed help. It has been a gradual renovation, starting with the floors. I took down the wallpaper and painted one section of Roxie’s bathroom, and then the project sat unfinished for a year! (I got a bit busy with my fitness business!) Yesterday, I finally got around to completing the bathroom and painting. Roxie decided to help, and we both learned a lesson about planning and preparation.</p>

<p>To prepare for painting, I put on an old T-shirt and pants that I don’t care about because I usually end up covered in paint. I covered the floors with drop cloths and got Pandora rocking. I was about halfway through when Roxie wandered in and decided she wanted to help. She is 6, and loves to paint. I was up on a ladder and cautioned her that this was <span class="italic">serious</span> paint. She was wearing her favorite purple leotard (version 2.0 if you follow me on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/rachelayerstipton" target="_blank">Facebook</a>; the original had to be retired in the Fall of 2014 due to overuse.) and I just <span class="italic">knew</span> this was going to turn out bad.</p>

<p>Roxie insisted she would be careful. I relented and she picked up a paintbrush. She dunked the brush into the paint, getting a bit too much and dripping it all over the floor. She almost immediately walked through it, getting it on her feet. She began innocently enough, painting a corner I thought would be harmless. I turned back to the wall I was working on, and about 30 seconds later I heard her cry out. She had moved to tackle the corner way back behind the toilet and leaned against the wet paint on the wall. There was paint all the way down her side and on her purple leotard.</p>

<p>I took action quickly and got the leotard off her to tackle the paint. But, the emotional damage was done. She was crying, upset, and worried that her treasured leotard was irreparable. I was able to completely remove the offending paint, wash the leotard, and have it back in action quickly. (Thank goodness!!)</p>

<p>Roxie learned her lesson: put on old clothes to paint! It simply never occurred to her that she needed<img class="right" width="225" height="300" src="{{site.url}}/images/2015/bathroom.jpg" /> to plan ahead, despite my warnings. She is definitely my kid, because I tend to leap before I look. I get excited easily and jump into things without thinking them through. When I end up with “paint on my leotard” and things fall apart, I can normally pull it back together. But, most of my setbacks could be avoided with proper planning.</p>

<p>The moral of the story is this: plan ahead. When you are beginning a project, whether it be a DIY home improvement or a new fitness program, you must think it through in order to avoid delays and setbacks. Schedule your time. Prepare the necessary tools for success. Consider pitfalls and challenges you might face. You want to be able to enjoy the experience as well.</p>

<p>And, of course, never paint in your best purple leotard!</p>
