<p>Yesterday, I spent 13.80. So far this morning: 18.90 at the grocery store and 203.93 knocking out some bills. I am striving to get my February rent and get all the bills paid up early so I can start to double payments on my smallest debt, getting me one step closer to UltraFitFinances. The big danger for me is to stay out of a scarcity mindset. Do <span class="italic">YOU</span> have a scarcity mindset about your money?</p>

<div class="centered-text">
	<span class="bold italic">“I’m broke.”</span>
	<span class="bold italic">“I don’t have enough money to….”</span>
	<span class="bold italic">“I wish I could, but I am poor…”</span>
	<span class="bold italic">“I’ll never have enough money to….”</span>
</div>

<p>Do you ever say anything like that? Yeah, I used to as well. Even if I am not exactly sure where the money is going to come from, I have become very conscious of what I say about my money and finances. In fact, my friends laugh at me when I point out that I am actually RICH.</p>

<p>Think about it:</p>
<p>You are reading this blog on either a computer or smart phone. You are <span class="italic">RICH</span>.</p>

<p>You have a place to live that has running water and electricity. You are <span class="italic">RICH</span>.</p>

<p>You have a fridge and pantry that likely contain more food than you could (or should) eat today. You are <span class="bold italic">RICH</span>.</p>

<p>I could go on all day pointing out the ways that you are in fact RICH. It’s all a matter of perspective. Now, if you go around saying to yourself, other people, and the Universe that you are <span class="italic">POOR</span>, you are likely to stay that way. You attract and create the reality that you <span class="bold italic">BELIEVE</span>.</p>

<p>So, why not change your inner dialogue. Start saying to yourself: <span class="italic">I am RICH</span>. Be grateful. Rich folks don’t <span class="italic">worry</span> about money. Get focused on being the best you can be at what and who you are. Are you a stay-at-home mom? Make that house sparkle today and create ways to make it fun for your children to help you. Are you a server? Smile and graciously help your customers today. Are you a CEO? Implement a new strategy to help your team feel more appreciated.</p>

<p>All of these small actions will attract prosperity. You might be surprised where it comes from. If you believe that the money will show up, it will. If you don’t, it won’t. Moms: you might find money in pockets of pants and change under the couch cushions. Servers: great service always raises your tips. CEOs: the appreciation you show your team will inspire greatness in them, increasing productivity, and boosting that bottom line.</p>

<p>Why? Because you are <span class="bold">RICH</span> and you deserve the <span class="bold italic">BEST</span>!</p>
