<p>It is true that being a dancer is one of the most complex physical activities one can pursue. A dancer must learn and retain intricate combinations of movement, sync it with music, AND make it look effortless! As a long time professional dancer and now a focused dance teacher and Coach, I can fully appreciate all that it takes to be a high performing athlete and artist. I can also understand on a personal level all of the struggles involved with being a dancer, heart and soul.</p>

<p>There’s a lot involved in being a dancer, and a whole bunch of pitfalls to be aware of and try to side step:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Nutrition – The physical demand on dancers as well as the pressure to be thin and fit can cause a lot of confusion, especially for young dancers. Eating disorders run amok in the dance world. When I was in my teens, the image of the dancer was still the “waif” for the most part and I REALLY struggled. I did some horrible things nutrition-wise!! From starving to binging and purging, I tried it all, but thankfully made my way to where I am today: equipped with the knowledge that proper nutrition can optimize my performance!</p></li>
<li><p>Self Doubt – Dancers train relentlessly and always in front of a mirror. Dance teachers are there critiquing every move and it is easy to fall into the quagmire of self-doubt, poor body image, negative self talk, and even self loathing. True dancers have a “never quite good enough” mentality and that is what keeps us coming back for more rigorous effort day after day. It is important to try to gain perspective in that dance is a process, and not a product. The continuous journey towards improvement is what is so amazing. Try not to get bogged down with today’s limitations.....set goals and work towards then with daily dedication and focus!</p></li>
<li><p>Competition – There is always an element of competition in a dance class. Eyes are constantly on one another to spot whose extension is highest and who nailed their pirouette combination. Competition in class (or on the actual competition circuit) can be healthy if it is used to PUSH yourself to work hard and strive for improvement and achievement. However, competition can also get ugly, causing jealousy, ruining friendships, and leaving dancers feeling bad about themselves. It is always best to try to approach the competitive aspect of dance with the attitude of being better than you were yesterday, rather than being better than someone else in the room!</p></li>
<li><p>Many dancers with a very high skill level still make comments like, “I suck today.” Or, “I can’t turn to the left.” Or even, “I am just not flexible....” ANYTHING can be achieved with the right mental attitude and the proper SMART goals laid out before you. Let’s DO this, dancers!!!</p></li>
