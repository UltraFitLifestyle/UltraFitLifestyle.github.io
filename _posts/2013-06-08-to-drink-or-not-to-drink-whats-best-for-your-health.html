<p>I know many people don‚Äôt want to hear it, but <span class="bold italic">it really is great giving up alcohol</span>. I have not had a drink for about a year and a half. I decided that I drank a bit too much and it was giving me some major problems controlling my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease" target="_blank">Crohn‚Äôs</a> symptoms. I was ‚Äúself-medicating‚Äù and thinking that it was helping my pain. Little did I know at the time, the white wine (my <span class="italic">FAVORITE!!</span>) was actually aggravating my condition.</p>

<p>There have been many studies that show the possible benefits of drinking one glass of wine per day. But, let‚Äôs face it; do any of you actually drink only <span class="bold">ONE</span> glass per day if you get into the wine?? Not me, when I was still drinking, no bottle of wine would make it to the morning light. Now, I am a ‚Äúspecial‚Äù case because I live with Crohn‚Äôs, but check out some of the benefits of giving up alcohol altogether:</p>

<p><span class="bold">1) WEIGHT LOSS!!!</span> I knew you would like that one. üôÇ Alcohol contains 7 calories per gram, so if you consume one beer per day for a year: that‚Äôs 17,000 extra calories. And <span class="italic">EMPTY</span> calories!! No nutritional benefits, and in fact, alcohol dehydrates you as it quenches your thirst. Not only does alcohol contain empty calories, but it also increases your appetite and decreases your will power. So, you are a lot more likely to hit the Waffle House at 2AM after a night out. Been there, done that!!</p>

<p><span class="bold">2) Save your Liver!!</span> We all know that alcohol puts a strain on your liver and pancreas. Eliminating alcohol can also reduce your risk of stroke, dementia, potential neurological issues, cardiovascular disease, and a variety of cancers. Alcohol can affect your hormones, too. Studies show that there is up to a 44% decrease in testosterone after 5 drinks. I am picturing guys at the club with too much Axe on, thinking they really have ‚Äúgame‚Äù, when their testosterone levels are dropping steadily!!! Yikes guys!!</p>

<p><span class="bold">3) Say Goodbye to the Hangover!</span> Let‚Äôs face it, even after a few drinks, you feel less than perfect the next day. One or two too many makes the entire next day a write-off. No workouts, no work done, lots of regret. Only one way to avoid that altogether: NO alcohol! And those embarrassing ‚Äúdrunk girl‚Äù moments‚Ä¶.no more. You know you‚Äôve had em!!!</p>

<p><span class="bold">4) Sleep Better!</span> We may think we sleep well after drinking, but rest is less effective after a few drinks.</p>

<p><span class="bold">5) Better Complexion!</span> I can honestly say I was that girl with the skin problems for the longest time. I mean I tried it all!! Now, I only drink water (LOTS of it) <a href="http://racheltipton.com/shakeology/" target="_blank">Shakeology</a>, and coffee, my one major vice‚Ä¶and my skin is MUCH improved. I get a blemish or two every once in a while rather than hoping for one day of good skin. <span class="bold">(FYI on water: you should be drinking 1/2 your body weight in ounces per day!)</span></p>

<p>It is definitely not easy to give up alcohol since it is such a social habit. People tend to think something is extremely amiss if you turn down a drink. Over time, I have become at ease requesting a club soda with a lime. It is light, refreshing,  and I can almost fool myself into thinking it is a real drink! And, if you have a drink in your hand, no one will think anything of it once they have THEIR drink! Besides that, no matter what social event I attend, I <span class="italic">KNOW</span> I won‚Äôt have to miss my morning workout due to a hangover.</p>

<p>Alcohol will <span class="italic">ALWAYS</span> be available, so if you want to give your health and weight loss program a jolt, give up the booze for a limited time‚Ä¶.like a couple of weeks to a month. See what happens. You might even like how you feel!!!</p>
