<p>I hear it all of the time from my female clients: <span class="bold italic">I don’t want to get bulky!</span> I totally understand some women’s fear of ending up looking too beefy if they commit to a weight training program. Most ladies want a long, lean, sexy look as a result of working out. The truth of the matter is that adding resistance training to your program will build strength in your muscles and bone structure, as well as giving you a more efficient metabolism.</p>

<p>I began an intense weight lifting program 5 weeks ago. One week ago, I started getting uber-focused <img class="right" width="300" height="200" src="{{site.url}}/images/2015/dont-give-up.jpg" />on my intake of protein and carbs. As much of a health nut as I am, I have noticed how I automatically shift into “I need to starve to get skinny” mindset. Archaic, I know. But, it is a hard habit to break that was developed over years and years of dedication to my dance career, which called for pretty much as thin of a frame as I could possibly manage.</p>

<p>This week, I pumped up my protein and my water intake. Now, I am pushing some serious heavy weight (for me), lifting 5 days per week, with 2-4 cardio sessions scattered through the week. I dedicate one day to rest, although 2 would be better. It is tough to fit it all in, as well as sleep (I really need more…..eek!) with my career and family life. I have an awesome Nutrition Coach in Leslie O’Neil (look her up>>>><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thebewellcoach" target="_blank">HERE</a>) who is guiding me through the best way to eat my way through this transformation of my body. I have done plenty of intense programs in the past, but this is the first heavy lifting program I have done and actually paid close attention to my nutrition.</p>

<p>I noticed in the last 2 days, that I feel a bit bulky, or as if I am retaining water. It is not the right time of the month to be retaining water, so I was wondering what was going on. <span class="bold italic">Slight panic</span>; the kind of panic I have observed in clients who begin building muscle while also attempting to lose fat weight. Leslie calmed me by reminding me that my body is reacting to all of these big changes and YES, my muscles are probably retaining water in response to the heavy lifting. But, all this will work itself out given a bit of time.</p>

<p><img class="left" width="192" height="300" src="{{site.url}}/images/2015/dont-give-up2.jpg" />Lean muscle mass lays against the bone, with fat surrounding the muscle. With muscle gains, the fat is pushed outwards. There comes a moment (like the one I am experiencing) when the muscle and fat are competing for space, so to speak. The lean mass is stronger, literally, and wins out in the end by burning off the fat, revealing that lean look we ladies crave.</p>

<p>I just have to stick with it. In the past, I would retreat and try to get back to skinny-land. But, strong is the new skinny for me. I am eating right and staying focused. I have 7 more weeks to go.</p>

<p>If a woman wants to get bulky, she can achieve that. However, a woman isn’t going to turn into a man by pushing weight (Thank God! Lol). So, ladies, don’t be afraid to push a little weight. I am taking the advice I give my own clients and staying with the program, allowing the transformation to happen as a result of hard work.</p>

<p class="bold italic">“The moment you are ready to quit is usually right before the miracle happens. Don’t give up….”</p>
