<p id="half-marathon-caption">My very first 1/2M!</p>

<p>I rise at 5:00am on weekdays, so getting up at 5 for my very first 1/2 Marathon this AM was not difficult. I arrived at the Coastal Grand Mall parking lot in Myrtle Beach at about 6:15. I am glad I arrived early, because I learned my first lesson about running a 1/2 marathon before the race even started!</p>

<p><span class="bold">1) Arrive early –</span> I was hydrating all the way from Pawleys Island, so I needed to hit the potty right away. May be TMI, but it was important in about 15 minutes when 3600 other people were trying to go potty before the race started!! The line for the 20 port-a-potties was at least a few hundred people deep. So, my habit of arriving early and getting the essentials out of the way came in handy without me realizing.</p>

<p><span class="bold">2) Be conservative out of the gate –</span> I have only ever run one other race, and it was a 5K. I went full blast out of the gate and got tired fast! So, under the advice of my Mom, who was an avid runner when she was a bit younger, I started slowly. I got a mile under my belt a little over a 10 min mile, then took it to an average 9ish mile for the next 9 miles. I never got exhausted or had to slow my pace to catch my breath, because I have trained consistently at about a 9-10 min mile for my long runs. (Thanks to my wise and experienced running buddies!)</p>

<p><span class="bold">3) Never judge –</span> My favorite runners today were a family of 4 who looked like they were having the time of their lives! The 2 teenage girls flew past me with their parents like it was nothing. They even stopped for someone to hit the potty mid-race, and I caught them. But, they went flying past one more time and I never saw them again. Fast runners come in all sorts of packages, so I came to realize that you cannot assume from a person’s body type that they will be fast or slow!</p>

<p>Being conservative with my energy early on paid off for me. I did mile 11 and 12 at 8:30ish mile. With a huge, goofy smile and pure adrenaline, I pushed for an 8:00-8:09 mile for mile 13.</p>

<p>My final race time was 1:56:56. I had an absolute blast!!!</p>

<p>I will keep my training up for my next event: Run Disney 1/2 Marathon on January 10!!!! Join me for a run, why don’t you?? Promise I won’t be pushing that pace in the near future.....</p>
