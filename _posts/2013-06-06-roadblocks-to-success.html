<p>All Roadblocks To Your Success Have Been Stripped Away</p>

<p>Those that succeed with their own business don’t accept roadblocks. They overcome obstacles, learn from others and are relentless at finding the right road to success. The biggest roadblock of all is your own fear of failure. We are here to tell you that your success is truly waiting for you. We are here to connect you with an established business model and new business development tools that have been proven over and over again.</p>

<p class="bold">What are the greatest fears of starting your own direct sales business from home?</p>

<ul>
<li>I don’t know that many people</li>
<li>I don’t like talking to strangers</li>
<li>I don’t have much extra time</li>
<li>I’m in too late and the big opportunity has passed</li>
</ul>

<p>If these are roadblocks that you still believe, then you need to keep reading on and stop accepting the limitations that nobody else has set other than you!</p>

<blockquote><p>Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts. – Winston Churchill</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="bold">I don’t know that many people.</span> This is may be a current reality. However, with the help of a large amount of social networks available online, you have the ability to meet extremely targeted prospects online from the comfort of your own home, on your own time. The social networks are your new business secret weapons. Anyone who says that they don’t know that many people, have not truly explored the incredible potential of the social networks for meeting the right, new people. That is why they are called “social” networks.</p>

<p><span class="bold">I don’t like talking to strangers.</span> When you learn to how easy it is to create a brand for your business that focuses on helping people just like you, all of a sudden your ability to find, connect and strike up meaningful conversations isn't so daunting after all. These are people just like you. They are people who will look at you and say, “you really get it.” Your brand is based on your life, struggles overcome, passions, hobbies, life stage, lifestyle, choices, etc. This makes it super easy to talk to people because you have so much in common right from the start!</p>

<p><span class="bold">I don’t have much extra time.</span> What if you could build your business, nationally or locally from the comfort of your own home, any time of day or night? Sound too good to be true? The reality is that social networking allows for you to tap into a global audience of your target niche. You can meet people at any time that you have the time to reach out and connect online. You don’t have to be live online with people to strike up meaningful dialogue and new relationships. Connections and messages, just like email, can happen over time. We have seen large direct sales organizations grow from nothing by the simple strategy of using social media.</p>

<p><span class="bold">I’m in too late and the big opportunity has passed.</span> That may be the case if you were trying to approach the exact same group of people with your business as everyone else. However, you are unique and so is your brand, target niche and thus ways to carve out your own opportunities that are 100% unique to you. And by the way, your niche market is a huge opportunity when you can connect with people locally, nationally and internationally from your own home. Niche audiences that let you laser focus on their needs are huge online. This is a strategy that is anything but limiting. Your unique opportunity is just waiting for you!</p>

<p>Don’t let your fears hold you back. Let the liberating realities set you free. <a href="{{site.url}}/contact-rachel">We are here to help!</a></p>
