<p class="centered-text">Back to School….fall….looming holidays….multiple jobs….workouts….supper!!??!!</p>

<p>It seems overwhelming and crazy this time of year. Harvest time, right? Everyone is trying to get on a schedule and get the KIDS on a schedule of getting up for school. Summer is OVER and everyone can focus a little better. But, suddenly, there’s SO much to focus on!!!</p>

<p>I have a 5-yr-old, an office job in <a href="http://www.litchfieldrealestate.com/" target="_blank">real estate</a>, an after-school job <a href="http://www.litchfield-dance.com/" target="_blank">teaching dance</a>, a home business, and I am on the board of my <a href="http://www.pawleysislandmontessori.org/" target="_blank">daughter’s school</a>. Oh, yes, I am also studying for my YES and FNS through <a href="http://www.nasm.org/" target="_blank">NASM</a>. And planning a Halloween fundraiser. I am sure I left a few things out. CRAZY BUSY. People say daily: “I don’t know how you do it!!” Let me tell you, some days I say the same thing when I look at my schedule and to-do list. But, there are a few ways to handle it all.</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="bold">Keep a to-do list.</span> EVERYTHING goes on my to do list. If I need to buy bananas or write a press release or make a phone call…it goes on the list. I keep a written daily list by my work space at the office, but I also use AnyDO app on my phone so my to-do is with me at all times. I look at it any time I feel “idle;” like what is next?? It is all right there and I know what is priority.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Carry a day planner.</span> Although everything goes into my phone, I carry my Franklin Covey everywhere and write it down there as well!</li>
<li><span class="bold">Meditate.</span> I take time daily after my morning workout to meditate for 13-15 mins. It helps me gain balance and a calm start to my day. So, I can handle whatever is coming my way. If the day has been over-the-top crazy and I cannot wind down, I repeat the meditation before bed.  To see my process, visit www.mindfulstrength.com</li>
<li><span class="bold">Say NO!</span> I am not too good at this, but getting better. Prioritize. If someone asks you to have coffee and you cannot fit it in, say, “Thanks so much for thinking of me, let me check my schedule and get back to you.” Then, look and see if you actually have time, this also gives you time to figure out if it is WORTH your time right now.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Focus on ONE thing at a time</span>. Multi-tasking is good, but you will get more done if you take it one at a time. Set a timer, so you get up and walk around for a little while between tasks.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Eat well.</span> Eat for fuel when you are going 100 miles per hour. Don’t eat junk. Keep healthy snacks available at all times for when unexpected things come up.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Hydrate!!</span> You can go for a pretty long time without anything else, but water is essential to keep you going!!!</li>
<li><span class="bold">Stop and smell the roses.</span> If you take a little time for yourself (for me, it’s my workouts and meditation), you will have a little chunk of happiness to get you through the inevitable stress. Take your time. I promise, when you are done with your “me” time, there will be PLENTY waiting for you….</li>
</ol>

<p>I didn’t even include exercise in the list, cause you KNOW I hold that as an essential!!!!</p>

<p class="bold centered-text">Hang in there!!!!</p>

<p class="centered-text">I gotta get back to work……</p>
