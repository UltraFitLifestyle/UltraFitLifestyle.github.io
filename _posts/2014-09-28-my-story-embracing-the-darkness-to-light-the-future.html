<p><img class="left" width="150" height="150" src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/winding-road.jpg" /><span class="italic">Once upon a time</span>, there was a little girl who wanted to grow up to be a dancer.</p>

<p><span class="italic">But, one day</span>, someone very important to her told her she was fat.</p>

<p><span class="italic">And because of that</span>, the little girl developed a very poor self-image, which led to an eating disorder. She did in fact grow up to be a dancer, which can be a tough profession for self-image.</p>

<p><span class="italic">And because of that</span>, she later fell in love with and married the first man who came along and told her she was beautiful. He ended up being a very abusive man.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Finally</span>, she gathered the courage to leave that abusive marriage, and get therapy to regain a positive self-image.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Ever since then</span>, the little girl has truly grown into a woman, facing other enormous challenges. Yet, no longer do these challenges cripple, hinder, or limit her life.</p>

<p><span class="italic">The moral of the story</span> is that other people or circumstances can hurt you or hold you back, but you can use those experiences <img class="right" width="150" height="150" src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/cloud-shadows.jpg" />as your springboard for growth.</p>

<p>I am sure you have guessed that this is <span class="bold">MY</span> story. I attended a business improv weekend recently, led by my awesome Coach, <a href="http://ginaandcompany.com/" target="_blank">Gina Trimarco Cligrow</a>. She had us “create” this little story about ourselves to help clarify our message in our profession. It was surprising to me when I began working on it that I dredged up these demons of my past. I always thought my eating disorder (actually plural….I pretty much tried every which way to abuse my body with starvation, binging and purging, diet pills, etc.) and my abusive marriage were things I should hide and be ashamed of. Now that I have seen my story laid out in this format, I realize that the darkness of my past can light my future. Even more than that, perhaps it can light the way for OTHERS and a brighter future for them!</p>

<p>I think there is a moment in everyone’s life that changes, shapes, and defines you. It comes back to you in vivid detail, like it happened yesterday; even when sometimes you cannot remember what happened earlier that morning!!! I can recall that moment when I transformed from a little girl who thought I was taking over the world, shining brightly……to a darker person with incredibly harsh and negative self-talk patterns constantly running through my head. That went on for years. In arts school, I had a couple of room mates who had some very intense, serious eating disorders that ended up causing them to leave school. I kept my issues under the radar so covertly, that I am not sure anyone really ever knew. Perhaps everyone knew all along! I had a long dance career, and some amazing experiences. However, there were some tough battles in my head; especially when mandatory weigh-ins came into play!</p>

<p><img class="left" width="150" height="150" src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/red-sunrise-150.jpg" />Clearly, my terrible opinion of myself led me to a relationship where I allowed a man to control me. I hardly saw it coming, because I was so dazzled by how exciting he was; how he called me Sweetie and seemed to cherish me. I had never felt that. But, once we were married, things shifted almost immediately and I lived in fear of him. I cowered and tried to do whatever he demanded. It was my doctor who began to notice that I was crumbling as a person. She suggested my “escape route.” Some women never leave a bad relationship; it can be terrifying. It was for me. I cried for an entire year. It was seriously rocky. But, tons of therapy later, I began to find myself again. I began to unravel all the tightly wound pain, hurt, and confusion. I began to believe in myself, and to remember that bright, shining little girl I had once been.</p>

<p>It took me years to get it together in terms of my eating habits and self-esteem. I actually walked away from my dance career when the stage manager at a show I was working for put me on “weight notice.” He suggested I stop going to the gym and smoke more cigarettes to keep me from eating. I was NOT going back down that dark road again. I left that path behind and chose a new one where I met my current husband. Thankfully, I had a healthy grip on my relationship with food when I got pregnant with my daughter. I gained a perfectly acceptable amount of baby weight, and lost it again quickly after my daughter’s birth by ordering P90X off of a late-night infomercial!</p>

<p>I was feeling good and quite strong. I thought of food as fuel. It was my friend instead of my enemy or nemesis. Then, one day, I caught a flu virus. I remember that my husband, Tommy, caught it first. I really asked for it, since I cajoled him that I thought he was faking it. Well, he was not faking and it got me good soon after. I was down for a week. When I finally got out of bed after a week, I still had no appetite. I only wanted a bit of bread and orange juice for another week. It went downhill from there. I began to notice blood in the potty that should not have been there, and NO one wants to talk about that! So, I kept that horrifying fact hidden….for months.</p>

<p>When the pain and bleeding finally got bad enough, I went to the doctor. The diagnosis was textbook Crohn’s disease. I had another rocky year of hospital stays and experimenting with which meds worked for me. We finally settled on Remicade: a lovely drug administered by IV every eight weeks to the tune of $9000 a pop. And the side effects are simply a joy (sarcasm!). I spent a great deal of time in bed staring at the cracks on the ceiling, coming to grips with the fact that I could not even care for my daughter. There was enough pain that I sometimes wondered if I was going to die. I did a little research, figured out I would likely NOT die. So, then a small light flickered on. It was time to fight back.</p>

<p>Slowly, but surely, I educated myself on nutrition and how it could affect my Crohn’s. I had to get rid of the ridiculous amount of wine I was guzzling to console myself. Dairy also got the axe. I soon fine-tuned what my body could handle and what it would not tolerate. I pulled out my P90X DVDs and got on track. I literally crawled my way through the workouts at first. But, I started to feel better. I added Shakeology to my routine and felt my energy return. I got stronger and stronger. I became so passionate about my workouts and Shakeo, that I became a Beachbody Coach. And, so began my love affair with fitness.</p>

<p>I have tried a lot of different career paths. But, fitness has always been a part of my life. Now, I tie it to helping other people <img class="right" width="150" height="150" src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/rainbow.jpg" />achieve greatness rather than JUST my own health and fitness level. Health and fitness can increase productivity in your job, improve relationships, and have an amazing positive effect on all areas of your life! I can do things now that I never could even before I was diagnosed with Crohn’s. I should not be able to do these things according to certain doctors and naysayers. But, I am doing it anyway!I live free from medications for Crohn’s and I enjoy a highly active life! I love showing other people that they can do amazing things as well!</p>

<p>Looking back at the darkness and the obstacles of my past, I realize that I am a survivor. I am an overcomer. All of these challenges have made me who I am: I never give up. I won’t be put down. I am intense, but I make no excuses for it. I am not afraid of very many things. I believe EVERYONE has challenges and obstacles. I believe we are all held back, or rather hold ourselves back from being our best. The MINDSET of overcoming is the key. Embrace the darkness of your past and USE it to your advantage. Use it to fight back. Use it as the springboard to your greatness. Use it to help someone else. That is my goal. I strive to help people discover their obstacles; then, find a way over, under, around, or through those obstacles to lead the very best life possible. I use my unorthodox motivation to sculpt the UltraFitLifestyle for anyone who wants my help.</p>
