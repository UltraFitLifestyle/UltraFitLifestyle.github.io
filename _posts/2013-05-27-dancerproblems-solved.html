<p>I remember my first dance class at age 5. I actually remember coming out of it and telling my Mom that I was going to be a professional dancer. And, I did exactly that! Thousands of hours were spent in the studio sweating and trying to figure out how to make my body do what I wanted: leap higher, stronger pirouettes, leaner muscle tone. I did enjoy a successful career as a professional dancer, but I ALWAYS struggled with my weight.</p>

<p>I actually retired from dance (the first time…) in 2002 when my production manager put me on weight notice. He suggested I “stop going to the gym so much and maybe smoke more cigarettes” to control my appetite. UGH, right??!!! I had only JUST gotten a grip on my problems with anorexia and bulimia, so I opted out of dance all together. Most dancers are on a CONSTANT mission to achieve the ultimate body; always stretching, training, and experimenting with diets to get just the right look and to be able to execute all the big leaps and turns that WOW the audience.</p>

<p>I have finally found the answer with <a href="http://beachbodycoach.com/ultrafitdancer" target="_blank">Beachbody</a>!!</p>

<p>I began with P90X, then moved on to try TurboFire, Brazil Butt Lift, Body Gospel, Hip Hop Abs, 10 Minute Trainer, and right now getting ready to finish my last week of Insanity!! I can honestly say I have never been in this great of shape EVER…even when I was 16 and dancing 6 days a week for hours on end. I was not HEALTHY back then. I had low self-esteem and I treated food as a comfort, a reward, or an enemy.</p>

<p>Now, food is FUEL for my workouts and Shakeology is a major player in my nutrition plan. I LOVE the way I feel. I can jump higher, have better stamina, and a stronger core than a lot of my young dancers at <a href="http://litchfield-dance.com/" target="_blank">Litchfield Dance Arts Academy</a>! And they are AWESOME dancers!!!</p>

<p>So ASK me how I do it….<a href="http://www.teambeachbody.com/en/signup?referringRepId=167784" target="_blank">JOIN my Challenge Group</a>….COMMIT to incredible health….and I will help you SUCCEED!</p>
