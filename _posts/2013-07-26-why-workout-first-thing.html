<p>I am a morning person. Always have been. Not to say I have not had my share of staying up late, but I <span class="italic">MUCH</span> prefer going to bed early these days….and getting up at 5:00AM. In fact, I love getting up now that I have formed the habit. Yes, I know it sounds crazy. It took me some time to shape this habit and there are days when I would rather stay in bed. But, overall, I adore the quiet of the morning and having time to get my day planned and most importantly, to get my workout in!!</p>

<p>I have a 4, almost 5 year-old daughter who is even more energetic than I am….which is pretty darn energetic!! When I used to do my workouts mid-morning or even midday, I would always have to stop to help her with a snack, some sort of mini emergency, or costume change. It got a bit frustrating even though I love her very much. It is just tough to stop an intense cardio workout and then start up again. So, I decided to get up early. Really early….so I could be certain I would not be disturbed.</p>

<p>I heard something on one of my personal development audios about early risers and the snooze button. <span class="bold">The deal is to try to avoid the snooze button.</span> When the alarm rings, just go ahead and <span class="bold italic">GET UP!</span> If the alarm goes off and you hit snooze 2-3 times, you are probably not going to bother. If you get in the habit of just rolling on out of bed, it will get easier and easier. Now, I admit I sometimes hit snooze ONCE, but I use that 8 minutes to think about my day and what is ahead. I also take a few moments to “send out love” to someone I know who is hurting. Just a little karma thing I also learned about through my personal development studies.</p>

<p>I usually lay out my workout gear in the bathroom the night before so I don’t have to think too hard. Then, I head to the kitchen to mix up my <a href="https://extranet.securefreedom.com/MillionDollarBody/csShopping/ShoppingCart_Detail.asp?PriceID=298666&Cat=Nutrition%20and%20Supplements|Sports%20Performance&AddToCart=" target="_blank">Energy & Endurance Formula (E & E)</a>. While I sip on that, I get my sneaks on and then <span class="bold">PUSH PLAY</span>. The thing about working out first thing is that you really DO get your workout completed before your body/mind even realize what just happened. If you stumble out of bed and <span class="bold">PUSH PLAY</span>, you won’t have time to make excuses. You just get it done and you are ready for our day!</p>

<p>Another thing about doing your workout first thing: It jump starts your day and you feel <span class="bold">GREAT!!!!</span> Unless you actually injure yourself, you are sure to feel amazing after a workout first thing in the morning. You may be exhausted right when you are done, but a few minutes later, you will feel alert and energized.  Your metabolism is kicking and you will be less likely to eat poorly during the day as you have already put in the hard work. I am at the point these days where I feel a little lousy if I don’t do my workout first thing in the morning for some reason.</p>

<p>It has been said that it takes about 21 days to form a new habit. So, if getting up an extra hour or two earlier in the morning sound like a death sentence, just keep that magic number in mind. Use a calendar where you can mark off your 21 days with a big “X.” It is pretty satisfying to do something simple like that to track your progress. You will find that after a few days, it is not so bad. Then, it gets easier and easier. Soon, your habit will be formed and you will cherish your quiet, early morning time.</p>

<p>The early morning isn’t for EVERYONE. But, it IS for achievers, successful people, fit and happy people, awesome people, and the like. Why not join us tomorrow morning? You have nothing to lose and everything to gain….</p>
