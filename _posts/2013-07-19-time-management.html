<p>It is 5:55 Am. I have already been up for an hour checking things off my to-do list. Why you ask? Well, for me, 5AM is the best time for me to get things done. I normally get up at 5AM to do my workout. Today, I am so far behind on my work, my blog :-), and have 6 hours of dance to teach, that I am taking a day off working out. Yeah…sue me…lol! I had to make the choice as to what was most important at the moment. It’s part of what I have learned about time management.</p>

<p>It seems that everyone I know is <span class="italic">BUSY!</span> We all have crazy, fast paced lives nowadays. I teach 4-9 hours of dance almost every day lately (Summer hours are bananas!). I am a Realtor and the market has been heating up. I am a personal trainer and Beachbody Coach. I am a Mom. I also have to make time for my husband. And then there’s the normal stuff like grocery shopping, cleaning, workout time, etc. And, sometimes….sleeping! So, I definitely need to stay on top of how I use my time. I try my best to stay very organized with every minute of my waking hours.</p>

<p class="bold italic centered-text">So how do I make it all work??</p>

<ol>
<li><span class="bold">Make a To Do List.</span> I start my day by looking at and revising my to do list. I prefer to put my list on my iPhone. But, sometimes, I will also make a written list for the day, because I just LOVE checking things off the list. I prefer the AnyDo app for my phone. There are a lot of apps out there you can get for you phone, but this one is very simple. Try a few different one to find the one YOU like best.  Evernote is another good one.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Use a day planner.</span> I take my Franklin Covey day planner everywhere. I put everything in there: appointments, daily to do’s (again!), phone numbers, notes on phone calls with clients, etc. It’s nice that it has 2 pages per day so I have lots of room to write stuff down. It’s a great way to stay organized and have everything laid out in front of me.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Track it.</span> At the end of last year, I felt overwhelmed and as if I had NO time to get things done. I started tracking the way I used my time for about 2 weeks. I wrote down <span class="italic">EVERYTHING</span> I did all day, from a 10 minute call to my Mom, to work time, to meal prep, and getting my daughter ready for school/bed. I wrote it in my day planner for reference. That way, I could really see where I spent my time and figure out where I had some extra time.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Eliminate.</span> Once you have tracked your time for a week or two, it’s all right there in front of you. Do you spend too much time watching TV, scrolling through your Facebook news feed, playing Candy Crush Saga…? If you track your use of time and find these “time wasters,” get rid of them!! If you really love Candy Crush, or have certain shows you really love, then schedule a limited time for those activities. But, get rid of the waste and you will add hours to your day to get important things done.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Create it.</span> As I mentioned above, I am best in the early morning hours. I like to get up before everyone else does and fit in my workout and I LOVE the quiet and focused time. Believe me, it was not easy when I first began this morning ritual. I didn’t <span class="italic">WANT</span> to get up. Snooze button city!! But, now, it has been about a year of getting up at 5AM, so it’s a habit that is hard to break even if I want to sleep in. Early may not be your thing. Perhaps your best time is at the end of your day. The point here is that you have to find time in your schedule to get what you need to get done….well, DONE! I you feel like you have no time, then create time. Get up and hour earlier or stay up an hour later.</li>
<li><span class="bold">FOCUS.</span> When you have certain specific tasks to complete, try to put a laser focus on getting then done in the shortest time possible. Set a timer for yourself to create urgency. Turn off your phone and any distracting noise makers (TV!!). You will find when you give yourself a time frame, you will get things done faster. I actually find it pretty fun!!</li>
</ol>

<p>Everyone on the planet shares the same 24 hours. You may think that there are some really successful people out there who have a slight edge over you. The slight edge they have is that they manage their 24 hours better than you. So, start today. Take a look at how you spend your time. Be sure you have your goals clearly written down and your to do list with you at all times. Get control of your time…don’t let time own you. You CAN accomplish all of your dreams and goals. You just have to get organized!! Now, ready, set….GO!!!</p>
