<p>I am big into writing down goals and looking at them often. I learned that over the last year of my personal development. It took a while to form that habit. I live in gorgeous Pawleys Island, South Carolina, so I decided that every time I saw a palm tree, I would look at my goals list, (We have lots of palm trees!!) I just achieved my #1 Goal (still secret TBA!!!) so I need to revise my goals list. I have decided that one goal will work towards is to improve my dance skills.</p>

<p>About this time last year, I became a Beachbody Coach and officially decided to take back my life from the pain, confusion, and resentment that went along with my Crohn’s disease. I’d had enough of being sick and tired!! Since then, I have gotten in the best shape of my life, in fitness, finances, AND mental health (still have a ways to go on all three, but the best place I have ever been…). I have figured out that there is NO reason we should put limits on ourselves. I had my GI doctor telling me that I would just have to live with feeling crappy all the time, and I thought <span class="italic">NO WAY!!! I do not accept that fate.</span> So, I created my own fate instead.</p>

<p>I am a fighter of Crohn’s disease; a Crusader against it!! It is a capricious little disease that can be quite painful and cause awful fatigue. But, with vigilance, I have been able to control my symptoms with exercise, nutrition, and my medications (which I hope to be rid of some day….grrr!) I live a VERY active life and have a lot to balance in my schedule. People ask me what happened to that sick girl they knew a few years ago, and who is this crazy, energetic girl I have become? I simply chose NOT to be the sick girl anymore. I set goals and went after them, not putting limits on myself. In fact, instead of saying to myself, “Take it easy, your Crohn’s might not be able to handle it,” I told myself, “PUSH yourself, you are stronger than your Crohn’s!!!”</p>

<p>I teach a lot of dance classes at Litchfield Dance Arts Academy, and have a beautiful facility at my disposal. And, I have a new goal:</p>

<p class="bold italic centered-text">get myself back in performance shape to get up on stage next Summer at the Team Beachbody Summit in the talent show!</p>

<p>Now, Summit is a huge event with 1000s of people in attendance. I have not yet been to Summit since becoming a Coach, but that is a goal as well. Committing to work from now until then on this solo dance piece will get me there with focus. I can’t show up looking out of shape dance-wise, because I want it to be special and a great representation of my Team. I also cannot show up with my business NOT advancing and growing, because I have goals there, too. It is a goal with a deadline and I gotta start now!</p>

<p>So, I am officially putting my new goal out there to you guys! (This is another great way to be accountable to your goals: public announcement!!) What is something you say to yourself that puts limits on who you are and who you want to be? Or is it an outside force, someone telling you you can’t do something???</p>

<p>Set goals and make them S.M.A.R.T. goals (<span class="bold">specific, measurable, attainable, relevant</span> and <span class="bold">time-bound</span>)….write them down…then, <span class="bold">go</span> for it…..tell us in the comments below….shout it from the roof tops!!!!</p>
