<p>I am currently studying for my <a href="http://www.nasm.org/" target="_blank">NASM</a> YES (Youth Exercise Specialist) certification. I was studying youth exercise psychology today and thought: “Wow, that pretty much applies to adults, too!!” We are all just big kids walking around pretending to be grown up most of the time! Well….at least I know I am!!</p>

<p>A major factor in child exercise psychology is self-perception. How does this person see them self? It seems a lot of children, especially teens, have trouble with self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is someone’s belief that they have the ability to accomplish a certain task or behavior. I see this a LOT with my young dancers. I show them a new or challenging dance combination and hear: “I can’t do that!” It seems like a knee jerk reaction for a lot of these kids. They are extremely talented, and I know they can do it if they just try. I spend a great deal of time encouraging them to just <span class="bold italic">STOP</span> saying <span class="bold italic">CAN’T</span>, and give it a whirl. I have to remind them that I do not expect them to be perfect the first time trying something new. Just <span class="bold">TRY!!</span></p>

<p>Funny enough, I have the same struggle with adults. I hear them say they want to lose weight, they want to get fit, or they want to change their body composition. I suggest a program, and they say “I can’t do <a href="http://racheltipton.com/my-store/" target="_blank">P90X</a>!!! That’s too hard!! I am so out of shape….my knee is bad….etc.” They do not believe they can actually do it! My experience proves that just about ANYONE can do P90X with the proper modifiers. Just ask <a href="http://youtu.be/-UMdKSvwpaQ" target="_blank">Richard Neal</a>….</p>

<p>Then, we come to self-esteem, which relates to an individual’s feelings of worth. This one is why some of us have had to have lots and lots of therapy. Something or a series of events occur in our life and we lose faith that we are important and worthy. EEKS!!!</p>

<p>Next, we get to body image, which is the way we see ourselves and how others see us as far as our physical appearance. Because body image plays such an important role in self-perception, it ultimately affects a young person’s life in the immediate and sometimes long into adulthood. I can remember one single incident that altered my body image for YEARS. I did not think I was “chubby” because I was so young. But, someone told me I was chubby one day and it really hit me hard. For years after, I struggled with eating disorders and “feeling fat.” One single moment in time….that’s all it takes for a kid.</p>

<p>I have found that a person who THINKS they are fat stays that way. Your entire attitude towards yourself and your journey are keys to success or lack thereof. So, HOW do we overcome all these fears, worries, and poor self-image???</p>

<p>Well, NASM lays it out for kids in 5 Easy Steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><span class="bold">Vision –</span> Visualize the journey. What exact changes in your body do you want to see? In what time frame?</li>
<li><span class="bold">Strategy –</span> Figure out what the program is and detail it out. Write it down. Tell someone else. Find a workout buddy….whatever it takes!!</li>
<li><span class="bold">Belief –</span> Emphasize to yourself that you really CAN do this!!! Feed your mind with positive literature and audio. Dump the poopy pants friends!</li>
<li><span class="bold">Persistence –</span> Do NOT give up….even if you encounter obstacles. Just keep going!</li>
<li><span class="bold">Learning –</span> Search for ways to educate yourself on how you can be more effective. <span class="italic">DIVE</span> into health and fitness headfirst.</li>
</ol>

<p>We are all children at heart, struggling to be accepted and approved of in this world. Be kind to yourself. Be kind to others. You CAN do this and you ARE good enough!! <i class="fa fa-heart" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>
