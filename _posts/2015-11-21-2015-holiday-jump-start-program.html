	<p>Ever find yourself in THIS situation during the holidays?</p>
</div>

<p>Here come the holidays! It’s the most wonderful time of the year <span class="italic">AND</span> the most stressful. Hustling and bustling, holiday parties, and the presence of indulgent goodies everywhere you look can easily overwhelm you. This Holiday Jump Start Program is designed not only to keep you on track, but also to help you <span class="bold">LOSE</span> weight through the height of the holiday season. If you follow the program and <span class="italic">DON’T</span> lose at least 5 lbs before the New Year, when everyone <span class="italic">ELSE</span> is getting started, then you get to work out with me in January for <span class="bold">FREE</span>.</p>

<h3 class="bold underline">Nutrition Plan</h3>

<p>A 30 Day Meal Plan will be provided, including a shopping list and recipes. Supplements will be suggested, but not required. Adding a protein shake as well as other supplementation is highly recommended for best results with this program. It is tough to get all of the nutrients you need every day solely through whole food meals, especially when adding more intensity to your exercise routine. You can explore the recommended supplement line at <a href="http://www.ultrafitlifestyle.1stphorm.com/" target="_blank">UltraFitLifestyle.1stPhorm.com</a></p>

<p>If you are concerned about preparing the suggested healthy meals, you can discuss having meal prep done FOR you by <a href="http://www.thebewellcoach.com/" target="_blank">Leslie O’Neill, The Be Well Coach</a>. Be Well meals will even deliver!! (Meal prep and delivery NOT included in the cost of the Holiday Jump Start Program.)</p>

<h3 class="bold underline">Mindset Coaching</h3>

<p>This is by far THE most important aspect of the program. The holidays tend to be an emotional time for everyone. This program will help you to explore some of the habits that are holding you back from achieving REAL results in your fitness. Perhaps some of these things are holding you back in other areas of your life! This part of the program includes daily reading, writing, and/or audio that will assist you with your personal development. Don’t worry, it will not be an overwhelming time commitment. However, it IS a huge deal, and a requirement for your success.</p>
