<p>It’s all about choices. My choices got me where I am in life. My choices affect what I do each day, what my bank account looks like, and the direction of my life. The great thing is that even though many things in this world are out of my control, my choices are always mine.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I spent $31.31 at the pharmacy. When I left, I was thinking about the items I chose: a few personal necessaries and some office supplies to assist me in organizing my taxes for 2015. By simply creating an awareness of my spending, I felt a pang of guilt that I could have probably made a better choice to get the office supplies somewhere else where it would have been less expensive. No biggie, but I learned something about my spending habits and why I still have a long way to go to get UltraFitFinances.</p>

<p>I usually prefer to pay more when something is right in front of me than to seek out a better deal. I would rather save time than save money. That’s a choice. I once had an elderly woman as a client. She liked to workout to relieve stress in caring for her husband who lives with early onset dementia. She fascinated me because even though she is one of the wealthiest women I know personally, she would drive all over town to find the best deal on raspberries. That’s a choice. Perhaps she has a little more time on her hands to seek out deals, but I suspect this choice to hunt down the best prices is a <span class="italic">habit</span>. Good spending habits are how the rich stay rich. My lazy habits in my spending are keeping me under water. It’s all about choices.</p>

<p>Tracking my spending behavior and writing it down each day is helping me become more aware of my choices. I am already starting to really think things through. Do I really need to stop and grab something to eat when I have groceries at home? Do I really need that Starbucks coffee? Do I really need to buy one more personal development book when I have several I have not yet finished sitting on my bookshelf? It’s all about choices. And, I am determined to make better ones!</p>

<p>This same method of tracking can be used for other things: tracking what you eat to assist in your weight loss goals, tracking your use of time to get more done each day, tracking your exercise to see your progress. If you want to see improvement in some specific area of your life, start tracking. Get a notebook, and carry it around with you (or create a note on your phone). Write down every detail of the area of your life you are trying to improve. For me, it’s every single penny I spend. Do this for a month and see what changes. The heightened awareness of what you think you are doing compared to what you actually are doing may astound you. It certainly will enlighten you. And, it probably will change you.</p>

<p>It’s ALL about choices.</p>
