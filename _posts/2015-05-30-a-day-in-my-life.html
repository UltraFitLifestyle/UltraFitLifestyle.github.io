<p>Sometimes I get push back from people because they think I am “scary and intense.” Of course, I do not see myself this way. A friend of mine suggested I share what a day in my life looks like, so my followers could get a glimpse of who I really am. The following is a typical day in the life of my UltraFitLifestyle.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The alarm sounds at 4:30am every weekday. Normally, I have a 5:00am client. (As of June 1, I will have Boot Camps in Pawleys Island Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 5:00am. Sign up <a>HERE</a>.) My husband is good about setting up the coffee pot the night before, so I simply “push play” upon waking. I also lay out what I am going to wear the night before, so I dress in the dark, throw some water on my face, and maybe a bit of mascara.</p>

<p>I am so grateful I began using Rodan+Fields on my skin last year. I can thank R+F for condensing my morning routine. I used to struggle with acne, which made me feel insecure. Can you imagine getting up earlier than 4:30 just to put on extra makeup? My skin is clear and glowing these days. Find out more about R+F <a href="http://www.ultrafitskin.myrandf.com/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>

<p>If I have only one client, I will head out with my cup of coffee and my bottle of water. If I have 2 clients, I will bring a green, organic apple (I am not a stickler for buying everything organic, but <a href="http://thebewellcoach.com/" target="_blank">Leslie O’Neill, The Be Well Coach</a>,  has taught me organic apples are a must.). I use the quiet time between when I leave the house and when I walk into the gym as my time to meditate. I have some in-depth meditations I have been focusing on lately, or I use <a href="http://www.carenbaginski.com/5-minute-meditations/" target="_blank">THESE 5 Minute meditations</a>. Sometimes, I simply get still for a few minutes. I have a busy and stressful life like everyone else, and I need to get myself centered.</p>

<p>I focus on my clients from 5-7:00, then home to get Roxie ready for school. The hour from 7-8:00 is always a whirlwind. Neither Tommy nor Roxie are morning people, so I have to use a lot of energy to get them both moving. I also make my breakfast, which normally consists of either a spinach omelet (1 egg+4 egg whites, no cheese), or cinnamon raisin Ezekiel bread with peanut butter. Ezekiel bread can be found in the freezer section of your grocery store. It’s a fantastic source of protein and amino acids. Read more about the benefits of Ezekiel bread <a href="http://authoritynutrition.com/ezekiel-bread/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>

<p>Once Roxie is at school, (or wherever she will be this summer!) I head back to Winyah Fitness One on One to service clients. My schedule is usually stacked from 8-12:00, and sometimes as late a 3:00. I serve clients one on one in person, or virtually. Find out about my virtual workouts <a href="https://www.wello.com/profile/UltraFitDancer" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>

<p>I constructed my life this year so that I could be there for Roxie after school. Last year, I was working so hard that I never had time for her. I do not want to miss these important young years with her. If I have free time during the day, I will do my own personal workout, make sales calls, shoot a video, or try to squeeze in some housework.</p>

<p>I always have a snack mid-morning. A hard boiled egg or a protein shake are my go to snacks. I have experimented with a ton of different shakes. I have finally found one that is simple: dissolves easily in water, tastes great, has a low caloric and glycemic index, and gives me 29 grams of protein. 1st Phorm, Phormula-1 in Juicy Watermelon is my jam right now. Find out more about 1st Phorm products and supplements <a href="http://ultrafitlifestyle.1stphorm.com/" target="_blank">HERE</a>. Lunch consists of whatever I have ordered from Leslie O’Neill that week, or my own meal prep of chicken, turkey, or tuna on quinoa with some spinach thrown in. I am actually quite boring when it comes to my eating habits. I am a creature of habit, as well as very conscious of what I eat, so that I can keep my Crohn’s disease under control. The simpler I make my eating, the easier it is to stay on track and achieve my current goals.</p>

<p>After school is playtime with Roxie. I love this time of day. I am so grateful for my awesome business Coach, <a href="http://ginaandcompany.com/" target="_blank">Gina Trimarco Cligrow</a>, for helping me build my own business so that I can control my schedule and my day. Working for myself allows me to make time for the things that matter most to me. Gone forever are the days of someone else deciding how I spend my time. Owning my own business can be terrifying at times, but also incredibly rewarding. I have big plans that WILL come to fruition. Stay tuned for aerial fitness and more!</p>

<p>I have taken on a few clients and classes in the evenings 3 days out of the week. When Tommy arrives home from school, he will take over with Roxie, and I can run back out to do my thing. This time last year, Tommy was still playing drums at a theater show 6 nights a week. We never had the chance to sit down and have dinner together. Because he is also on the path to running his own business as a cosmetologist, we are able to have dinner as a family. This is a big deal, since again it did not happen for the four years he was at the theater. Dinner is either chicken or some other protein, with lots of veggies, and quinoa or rice. I only use sushi rice; we love the taste and texture. Brown rice is tough on my digestive system due to Crohn’s. Lately, I am cutting out the carbs at dinner for myself, in order to reach some specific goals; so, protein and veggies! Roxie eats typical kid fare: hot dogs, chicken legs, or chicken nuggets. I hope help her improve her eating habits, however, I try not to force the issue. Tommy and I eat so healthy, she is bound to follow suit when she is ready. I try to choose my battles wisely as a parent. Lord knows it is tough to do right as a parent sometimes!</p>

<p>After dinner, I play catch up on emails and online business. I do not watch TV. I am a Type A workaholic, however, I love my work. Because I am so passionate about helping people improve their health and fitness, it hardly feels like work most of the time. I always have new ideas, and I have to watch myself so that I do not chase random “rabbits” that are not a benefit to my business or my personal well-being. I work efficiently, taking care of what MUST be done, and leaving what I can until tomorrow, so that I can hang out with my family.</p>

<p>I get Roxie to bed and myself to bed by 9:30. 10:00 tops, or I am seriously hurting the next morning when the alarm goes off at 4:30. Although it is advisable to turn off technology 30 minutes prior to bed, that never happens for me.</p>

<p>Today is unique. Today, I started prednisone to treat a flare of my Crohn’s disease. I have been feeling poorly for about a week, and I finally decided it was time to tame the beast with medication. I am not happy about it. Prednisone is not fun. But, I know it will get me better. I have not had serious flare in the last year. I’d say I manage this Crohn’s pretty well. Read more on my Crohn’s journey <a>HERE</a>.</p>

<p>That’s it, my typical day. Weekends are pretty chill, also a personally constructed choice. If you thought I was scary and super-human prior to reading this, I hope you can see that I am just another soul, struggling along to make things work. If you have fitness goals that you want to achieve, I can help you. Just shoot me a message <a href="{{site.url}}/contact-rachel" target="_blank">HERE</a>. I always have my phone nearby!! I would love to help you get started on YOUR UltraFitLifestyle.</p>
