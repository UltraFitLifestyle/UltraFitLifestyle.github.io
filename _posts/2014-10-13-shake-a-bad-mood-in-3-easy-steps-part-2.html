<p>Last blog I wrote was entitled "Shake a Bad Mood in 3 Easy Steps" An amazing blogger pal of mine, named Jessica (check her out <a href="http://whereismyguru.com/" target="_blank">HERE</a>!!) read it and let me know she was thinking she was going to get a good <span class="italic">Health Shake</span> recipe instead of a bit of advice on how to get rid of the blues. I found that really interesting in two ways:</p>
<!--more-->
<p>1) Amazing how different people perceive things.</p>

<p>2) I am a health shake junkie, so that must be a sign I should share my favorite recipe!!</p>

<p><img class="left" width="150" height="150" src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/pink-shakeo.jpg" />I am a creature of habit; I don’t get too creative with <span class="italic">any</span> recipe most of the time. I stick to what works for me. This is mostly because I have analyzed and tweaked my diet so scrupulously due to my Crohn’s disease, in order to discover what my body will and will not tolerate. I rarely stray from a very basic diet routine. When I do, I know that my body may react.</p>

<p>That being said, I <span class="italic">DO</span> like yummy things!! I found that nutrition in liquid form makes me feel really good, so I have a shake every day. Usually, I drink it for breakfast. Here’s my recipe:</p>

<p>1 packet Shakeology (if you’d like to know more about what Shakeology is, click <a href="http://www.shakeology.com/ultrafitdancer" target="_blank">HERE</a>)<img class="right" width="150" height="150" src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/me-and-shakeo.jpg" /></p>

<p>1 banana</p>

<p>Ice</p>

<p>So Delicious coconut milk – unsweetened</p>

<p>I prefer the Strawberry Shakeology over all the rest, but I like all the flavors and this simple recipe works with them all. My second fav is Chocolate, and I will throw in a TBSP of PB2, which is a killer powdered Peanut Butter!!! I hit the health shake daily; it ALWAYS make me feel fantastic. Think about it: nutrients in liquid form can be absorbed <span class="italic">immediately</span>, little to no digestion required. So, your body instantly goes YAY!! try it <img class="left" width="150" height="150" src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/chocolate.jpg" />and you’ll see.... <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>
