<p>I always defer to fitness and exercise to heighten my mood every day. However, there are simple ways to shake a bad mood that don’t require workout clothes.</p>

I take a quick drive over to Pawleys Island and breathe in all the beauty of the place that I live. I think about how amazing my daughter is and get grateful about how she is so sweet and, thankfully, healthy. It doesn’t take much to get grateful. Just be quiet, focus on the breath moving in and out of your body, and remember that life really CAN be simple.</p>

<p><span class="bold">2) Forgive –</span> Holding a grudge can kill your mood. Hanging on to something someone else did to you <img class="right" width="150" height="150" src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/beachpastel.jpg" />rarely affects the other person. They may not know or even care that you feel wronged, hurt or angry. You are only hurting yourself. Even more damaging, is staying angry with yourself. Forgive yourself for messing up, saying, or doing the wrong thing. Let it go. Today is a new day. Forgiveness sets you free!</p>

<p><span class="bold">3) Get Moving –</span> Ok, here’s where you <span class="italic">could</span> do the exercise thing to get moving. But, any type of action can help shake off that bad mood. Get to work on a project you have been putting off; dive deep into something to take your mind off things. Put all our energy into cleaning the house. The sparkle will make you feel better. Get focused on your business; set a small goal for the day and go for it. It does not really matter <span class="italic">what</span> the action is that you take, as long as you <span class="italic">take action</span>! If you stay stuck, you might stay stuck in your bad mood.</p>

<p>A bad mood is bound to strike. But, it does not have to ruin your day. Try these simple steps next time you get down and let me know if it helps!</p>
