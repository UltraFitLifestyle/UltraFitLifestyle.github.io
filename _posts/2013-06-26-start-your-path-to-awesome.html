<p>I am reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Start-Punch-Escape-Average-Matters/dp/1937077594/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1372163804&sr=1-1&keywords=john+acuff+start" target="_blank">Jon Acuff’s book “Start”</a> on my iPhone (how weird, but incredibly handy to keep books on my phone??!) and it is <span class="bold">AWESOME</span>. It’s all about <span class="italic">HOW</span> to be awesome. I am sooo into that because I really want to be awesome someday….I am definitely on the path to awesome, I think. Boy, oh, Boy it is a difficult path!!! But, who ever really stood up in elementary school and said, “When I grow up I want to be average…..”????</p>

<p>But, somehow, most of us (including me) get off track from our big dreams because we learn somewhere along the way that we are “supposed” to do certain things and “NOT supposed” to do a lot of the fun, wild, risk-taking stuff. Think about it: ALL your friends don’t run off every weekend and jump out of airplanes for fun; it’s just that one CRAZY friend of yours…lol! But, it sure seems like he’s having fun with it!! So, are YOU having fun and living the awesome life you dreamed of?? If not, why not???</p>

<p>As I said before, I am on the PATH of awesome. I have not yet achieved the perfect, simple, carefree life of my dreams. But, I DO know what that looks like in my head and I think about it when the path to awesome gets rocky and tough. I have certain financial, personal, and health and fitness goals that I am working towards daily. It sucks sometimes and I just don’t wanna….but I think about that dream of an ideal life and I keep going. It happens to me in my workouts, in my daily work schedule, at the dance studio, in my family life, and in my eating habits. <span class="italic">SOMETIMES</span>, I want to crawl into bed and pull the covers over my head and eat cupcakes all day long!! <span class="italic">SOMETIMES</span> I want to give up….</p>

<p>However, that image does not fit in with the goals that I have planned for myself. So, I don’t do that….not saying a cupcake isn’t a great idea every once in a while!!! Yum!! Consistent daily effort over time is what’s going to get me where I want to be. So, I keep on truckin…</p>

<p>So, are you ready to start YOUR path to awesome?? <span class="bold italic">Try these 3 action steps:</span></p>

<p><span class="bold">1) Sit down and think about what your ideal life would look like</span>….I mean the perfect, carefree, happy image that is so wild and crazy you have never even SAID it aloud…</p>

<p><span class="bold">2) Take out a pen and paper</span> (or create a note on your phone…even better cause your smartphone is always with you if you are like me) and write down what that looks like. What do you do for work? Where are you living? With who? What do you do for fun? What do you look like? etc….</p>

<p><span class="bold">3) Once you are finished, come back to it later</span>….and then tomorrow….and the next day….and keep revising it as your dream life takes shape.</p>

<p>Have fun with it….DREAM BIG! Why not??? You have nothing to lose, and everything to gain by dreaming up your awesome life. It probably won’t be as easy as it seems. Post your BIG DREAMS in the comments below and COMMIT to jumping on the path of awesome. It’s a GREAT place to spend your time!!</p>
