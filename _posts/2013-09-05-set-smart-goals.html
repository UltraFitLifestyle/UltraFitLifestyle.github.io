<p>You are smart, I know you are...you are capable of reading this sentence and understanding. Pretty basic and simple. So, if you are so smart, are you setting SMART goals for yourself?? Have you ever heard of the term SMART goals? Setting SMART goals can help you achieve your wildest dreams in fitness, dance, health, wealth, and pretty much any other area in life!</p>

<p class="centered-text"><span class="bold">SMART</span> is an acronym for:</p>

<p><span class="bold">S –</span> Specific – Set goals that are as specific as possible. For example: “I want to lose weight,” is not very specific. But, “I want to lose 10 lbs” gives you something specific to work towards.</p>

<p><span class="bold">M –</span> Measurable – It is important to be able to measure your progress. After a week or two of trying, you probably haven’t lost all 10 lbs, but you will probably have lost some if you are doing what you are supposed to do. The scale (I HATE the scale.) or measuring your waistline will give you some numbers that can help you track your progress.</p>

<p><span class="bold">A –</span> Achievable – A couch potato who sets a goal of running in the next Olympics is not very realistic. A more achievable goal would be to commit to exercise 3 times a week and running in a local 5K in the next 12 months.</p>

<p><span class="bold">R –</span> Realistic – Let’s get real here. If your goal is to be the next President of the United States and you have never been involved in politics, you are in la-la land. Set a realistic goal, such as commitment to become involved in politics in some specific way....at least to find out if you can actually hang in that environment!</p>

<p><span class="bold">T –</span> Timely – Give yourself a time frame so that there is more urgency in staying committed to the work it will take to achieve your goal.</p>

<p>I am a believer in setting goals and writing them down. Dream big. Don’t settle. But, make sure you are SMART about it!!</p>

<p>Remember the old story of the tortoise and the hare? It is true that slow and steady wins the race.</p>

<p class="centered-text">Get focused. Get specific. And then, get to work!!</p>
