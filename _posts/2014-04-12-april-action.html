<p>April has been a BIG month so far! I had April 1st as my “D-day” for a long while as my day to leave real estate behind and put my full energy into my fitness business. I have not looked back! Instead, momentum is building!!</p>

<p>I have started my own Boot Camp with 3 more in the works for May. I also joined <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Chief-Big-Daddys-Boot-Camp/215427511803369?ref=br_tf" target="_blank">Big Daddy’ Boot Camp</a> on off mornings to have someone ELSE kick me in the pants for a while!! Last week was my biggest sales week to date with my Beachbody business. I am SOOOO thrilled about that.<img class="right" width="150" height="150" src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/back-flex.jpg" /> I have added a brand new Coach this week and have several new people that might also join my Team!!</p>

<p>I have been on a serious health kick to prep for the upcoming <a href="http://www.facebook.com/SherylCrowTribute" target="_blank">Maybe Angels</a> show on May 17th at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/KlockersTavern" target="_blank">Klocker’s Tavern</a>. Videographer scheduled, so I have the pressure on me to practice daily as well as keep my health and nutrition in line. It is a great thing to have a goal and a dead line. Otherwise, it is too tough to stay on track sometimes.</p>

<p>YOU can reach your goals. ANY goals. Set your goal. Aim high. Get to work. Don’t let anything stand in your way!!!!!</p>

<p>If April has been this great so far, I look forward to what the rest of the warm weather and May have in store!!!</p>
