I was in a Pilates mat training course over the weekend, and the very knowledgeable instructor laid that bit of info on a class full of women. We all giggled, since a man in a Pilates class is somewhat out of the ordinary. Too bad, though. Pilates is not just for the ladies; it’s great for everyone at every fitness level!</p>

<p>Joseph Pilates was born in Dusseldorf, Germany in 1880. He studied martial arts, yoga, gymnastics, and boxing in a effort (surprising for that time) to be healthy. He was sickly as a child, which motivated him to seek out endeavors in wellness as an adult. In 1914, he was interned at a work camp in England. It was here, using the springs from the beds, that he developed the apparatus that we now know as the Reformer and Cadillac.<img class="right" src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/pilates2.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></p>

<p>Joseph emigrated to the USA in 1925. He met and married his wife, Clara, and together they opened the first Pilates studio in New York City, located at 939 Eighth Avenue. Joseph was surprised to find that the male population in the USA were not overly receptive to his methods. The men were not enthused about Joseph’s insistence on stripping down to your skivvies to stretch and exercise.</p>

<p>Joseph Pilates found a strong following with George Balanchine (founder of the New York City Ballet), and Martha Graham (famous modern dance innovator) and their dancers. The dance community could <img class="left" src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/pilates3.jpg" width="150" height="150" />feel right away that Pilates method was an amazing way to build strength and stamina. It was not until the last few decades that Pilates rose to popularity in the general population.  Perhaps the huge dance following further pushed the male population in the 21st Century away from Pilates.</p>

<p>However, the method was in fact developed by an man FOR men! Pilates can help anyone of any fitness level with core strength, breathing, stamina, flexibility, and mind/body awareness. Get ya some today!!</p>
