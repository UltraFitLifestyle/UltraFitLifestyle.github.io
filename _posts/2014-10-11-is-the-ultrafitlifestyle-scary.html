<p><img src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/pumpkin.jpg" class="left" width="225" height="300" />I am passionate about fitness, that’s no surprise. It concerns me that I am hearing lately that I am “scary,” “intense,” and that the UltraFitLifestyle that I talk about all of the time is “unattainable.” The truth is that the UltraFitLifestyle is customized for everyone. Everyone is at a different fitness level, or perhaps even starting from zero. You are not going to have to do what you see ME do. You will start where YOU are capable of starting. It does not have to be scary!</p>

<p>If you go read <a href="{{page.previous}}" target="_blank">my story</a>, you can see where I come from and that is why I am so intense with my own fitness. It’s my passion and my profession. I have specific goals. But, I do not expect my clients to follow the schedule I follow. That’s MY schedule that I have worked toward for years. Fitness is also part of how I manage my Crohn’s disease. I <span class="italic">enjoy</span> an intense challenge. But, when it comes to <span class="italic">your</span> UltraFitLifestyle, I start with <span class="bold">YOU</span>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Where are you today?</li>
	<li>What are your goals?</li>
	<li>What are your limitations?</li>
	<li>What are your fears?</li>
	<li>What do you <span class="italic">love</span> to do and what do you <span class="italic">hate</span> to do?</li>
</ul>

<p>I had someone comment on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/rachelayerstipton" target="_blank">my Facebook page</a> the other day: “I wouldn’t last 5 minutes in your boot camp!” It made me smile, because people must really have the wrong impression about my boot camp. We workout, we sweat, and the girls complain about being sore. But, what we <span class="bold italic">REALLY</span> do for that hour is laugh, talk about our kids and significant others, and help the person who brings a problem “to the table” and needs some help. Sometimes I am the one who needs help with a problem!</p>

<p>So, the UltraFitLifestyle is not really so scary after all. In fact, it could be just exactly what you need. Give it a chance.</p>
