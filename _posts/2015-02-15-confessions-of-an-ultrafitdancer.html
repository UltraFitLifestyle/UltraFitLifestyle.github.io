<p>If you <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ultrafitdancer" target="_blank">follow me on Facebook</a>, you know how I love to spout off motivational stuff. I have always been that way, even back at Virginia School of the Arts. When I studied dance there in the early 90s, pre-Facebook, I would post daily inspirational quotes on my dorm room door. I am a silver-lining, never-give-up kind of survivor. Because of my past experiences and my daily struggle with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease" target="_blank">Crohn’s disease</a>, I believe that everyone can conquer whatever life dishes out, no matter how difficult. I try to help others see that strength in themselves through fitness and the #UltraFitLifestyle.</p>

<p>But, I have a dark side, just like anyone else.</p>

<p>My dark side comes out when I feel insecure or frustrated. I can be moody. I can be mean. I can get out of hand. I am passionate. As much energy I put out motivating others with all my might, I can put out in a negative way as well. Yikes, imagine that?!</p>

<p>I lost my confidence when I was pretty young and someone told me I was “fat.” I spiraled down the ugly path of eating disorders. I learned to drink to excess to dull the ache of insecurity and self-loathing. I allowed people to treat me with disrespect because I thought I deserved it.</p>

<p>But, when Crohn’s came along and I experienced a health smack down, I decided I deserve better. In fact, I deserve the best treatment from everyone, including myself! After quite a bit of soul searching, I took a long, hard look in the mirror and assessed the real me. The me that was trying to drown my pain in white wine and sweet treats. I knew I needed a change.</p>

<p>Quitting alcohol was a struggle, but it has been four years. I realized that drinking alcohol was having the same effect on my insides that it has when you pour it over an open wound. I could probably be just fine if I only drank the 5 oz of wine suggested as a serving. But, that is <span class="italic">NOT</span> how much wine I want to drink. I pretty much want to drink a whole bottle once I get started. Since it is all or nothing for me, I decided on nothing. At first, I felt deprived and cheated; it simply was not fair. But now, four years later, I observe the effects of alcohol on others and I don’t miss it at all.</p>

<p>I see people drink a bit too much and lose focus on their workouts. I observe that there is a link between how difficult it is for some to lose those pesky 10 lbs and how much or often they drink.  Giving up alcohol is a choice that makes some people uncomfortable. Friends of mine know that my husband and I no longer drink, and we cannot help but wonder if that is why we are seldom invited to parties. Hmmm.</p>

<p>Does that hurt a little and send me to my dark side? Sure. However, I love this UltraFitLifestyle I have created for myself.  I manage my Crohn’s without medication. I enjoy sharing my ways with others so they can sculpt <span class="italic">their</span> UltraFitLifestyle.  There is no way I could run 1/2 marathons, train others, train myself, and keep the schedule I keep if I still drank alcohol. I would be in Crohn’s flare hell. I still struggle with the sugar addiction. Sometimes I simply cannot help myself as far as cupcakes are concerned.</p>

<p>I am laser focused on achieving the UltraFitLifestyle, but I remain a human with weaknesses.</p>
