<p>I have had a few people comment lately that they WOULD join my fitness Challenge Group if it wasn’t at 5:00AM!! It made me realize that people must not REALLY know what my fitness Challenges are all about! So, let’s get this straight.</p>

<p>I run Boot Camps locally at 5:00AM for people who find that is the ideal time for them to schedule in their fitness. They split out of Boot Camp, head home to get the kids up, and get to work! It’s not for everyone; but I just so happen to adore the early morning. My Challenge Groups are for everyone else’s schedule. It doesn’t even matter if you live in the same town as me!!</p>

<p class="italic bold centered-text">Here’s the deal . . . it’s simple!</p>
<img class="centered-text" width="150" height="150" src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/challenge.jpg" />

<p class="bold centered-text">PREMIERE FITNESS + PREMIUM NUTRITION + PEER SUPPORT = SUCCESS</p>

<p>The commitment is (90/60) days of a Beachbody® workout program, Shakeology®, and the Challenge Group accountability page.  You commit to the Beachbody workout program of your choice, Shakeology once a day, and a Challenge Group spot for accountability and support. We all work together and help each other WIN!  This is a proven and simple formula, and those who commit are much more likely to finish and GET THE ABSOLUTE BEST RESULTS!</p>

<p>—You do everything at home, on your time and your schedule. No in-person meetings or group workouts.</p>

<p>—Group interaction is all done on Facebook, so you can post along with the team each day.</p>

<p>The Challenge Group begins on a specific date. The initial investment is between FREE and $205 depending on what you have or need to get started.  Do you already have your preferred Beachbody program? Shakeology?  Or do you need to order both?</p>

<p>One more thing: If you complete your Beachbody program, you can enter to win $500 from Beachbody. Really. No fooling. Winners are selected daily. Once you complete your program, you submit your story and your before and after pictures. You automatically receive a free T-shirt proving you completed your program, and also have a change to win!! I actually won the $500 2 years ago right before Christmas!! Talk about handy!!</p>

<p>So, don’t be afraid to give my Challenge Group a try. ANYONE can do it. There are lots of programs for every fitness level. Ask me about joining the next group!</p>
