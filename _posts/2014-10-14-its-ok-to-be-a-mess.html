<p><img class="left" src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/bradpitt.jpg" width="150" height="150" />I had a few things happen over the last few days that have really got me thinking. Thinking about my business. Thinking about myself. Thinking about every aspect of my life. It has been kind of heavy. I had a wonderful friend call me out of the blue, and I confessed, “I am just a mess.” To which she replied, “It’s ok. Just be a mess then.”</p>

<p>It was really a relief to hear her say that. I honestly have been exhausting myself lately attempting to keep it together and take care of everyone else. I project positive energy out to all of my clients, challengers, friends, and followers. I want to help you through your tough moments. But, I have my tough moments, too. And, I am so grateful that my friend helped me see that I am <span class="italic">allowed</span> to fall apart. I am <span class="italic">allowed</span> to give myself a break. I am <span class="italic">allowed</span> to ask for help.</p>

<p>There’s nothing earth shattering going on with me. Just growing pains in my business and personal life. I strive to be better. I want to be more successful. I want the best for my family. With all that comes much more responsibility. It’s not easy. I am giving myself a break and allowing myself to be a hot mess. These moments never last long. We all need a good cry and a little moment to meditate quietly on the next step.</p>

<p>So, if today is the day you think you are a mess, just be a mess. Life is messy. Start right there. Figure out what’s <span class="italic">really</span> eating you.</p>

<p>You are going to be ok. It will all work out. You got this!</p>
