<p>I canâ€™t disclose much about it right now, but my family just had a shift and we are entering a <img class="left" width="150" height="150" src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/leapoffaith.jpg" />NEW chapter. Possibly the greatest era so far in my family!!! It is scary and filled with adrenaline. But, we have been working our way towards it and we are READY!!!! Courage, faith, hope, and HARD WORK will get us ALL the way where we want to be!!!!</p>
