<p>We have all heard the phrase “Don’t compare yourself to others.” But, we STILL do it! Especially in terms of fitness levels.</p>

<p>I wonder why?</p>

<p>I would not compare the writing skills of a baby to those of a high school student. That’s simply unfair.<img class="right" width="150" height="150" src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/drawing.jpg" /> Time and experience give the older child the clear advantage. So, as adults, why, when we have been busy with pregnancy, or kids, or disease, or injury, or life in general, would we compare ourselves to a fitness professional or model in the media? It is apples to oranges. Physical fitness has been the focus of these fitness professionals and models; likely for years!</p>

If you are just starting and struggling to get to your goals, try not to compare yourself to others. ENVISION how YOU will look and feel once you reach your goal. Stay focused on what you have accomplished rather than how far you have to go. As soon as you reach your goal, there will be another one to reach. So, enjoy the journey and celebrate each tiny success!</p>
