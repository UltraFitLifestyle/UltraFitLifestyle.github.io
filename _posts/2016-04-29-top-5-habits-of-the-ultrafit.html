<p>I am pretty sure I have never met a single person who did not wish to be in better shape. Everyone is searching for the quickest and simplest way to look and feel like a superstar. So, what do the real life mega stars DO to get that UltraFit? It’s simple really, although not necessarily easy. You can get UltraFit too if you begin to consistently implement the following habits into your lifestyle:</p>

<p><span class="bold">1) Don’t Diet; Eat Breakfast –</span> If you are a chronic dieter, you have probably learned by now that diets just don’t work. The yo-yo effect of feeling deprived and then self-sabotaging can be disastrous on your body and your spirit. Drop the diet mentality, and begin thinking about fueling the machine. If you woke up each morning and the gas in your car had evaporated, you likely would not make it to your first destination. Perhaps you could get somewhere on fumes, but not very far. Think of your body in the same way: you MUST start off the day by feeding your body with good quality fuel (protein is the best option). Studies show that people who consistently eat a healthy breakfast tend to be leaner. If you are not a “breakfast person,” then at least throw back a protein shake on the way to the office or school drop-off.</p>
<p><span class="bold">2) Make Exercise a Habit not a Chore –</span> Would you wake up in the morning and head out the door without brushing your teeth? Most likely not. Why? Because it is a habit. It’s not as much a chore as it is a positive choice to ensure that your first encounter with another person is a pleasant, rather than embarrassing, one! If your mindset is, “Ugh. I really need to go to the gym,” then try shifting it. Or, find another form of exercise that you do enjoy. At first, you may have to work at the mental side of things; a new habit takes about 21 days to stick. Encourage yourself that inertia will kick in and that this new routine will soon be a habit. Stay consistent on the time of day you workout so that your body comes to expect it. When you reach the point where you feel deprived when you don’t workout, you know you are in business! Daily exercise is a positive choice that will enhance every encounter with another person!</p>
<p><span class="bold">3) Don’t Compare Yourself to Others –</span> We are all different and amazing in our own way. We are also walking our own unique path and fighting our own battles. It is never a good idea to compare yourself with others. It will only lead to frustration. Your body is unique and awesome. It’s the only place you have to live, so be kind in the way you treat yourself and talk to yourself.</p>
<p><span class="bold">4) Get Some Rest –</span> We have all heard the advice of getting 8 hours of sleep at night. While this may not always be possible, try to get as much rest as you can. Our bodies make the best gains during rest. If you are on the fast track to getting fit and extremely goal oriented, be sure to take at least one day per week to rest. No exercise except for light walking and stretching. Your body needs a chance to repair itself.</p>
<p><span class="bold">5) Set Up a Support System –</span> Accountability and support are essential to success. Find a workout buddy. Join a support group or group fitness class. Hire a personal trainer. It’s tough to reach ANY goal all by yourself. So, build a team of encouragement all around you. It will help you on the days when you just do not feel you can get through a workout.</p>
