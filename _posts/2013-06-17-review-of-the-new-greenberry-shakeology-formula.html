<p>I tried Beachbodyâ€™s <span class="italic">NEW, IMPROVED</span> Greenberry Shakeology formula in just my shaker cup with coconut milk and ice to get the full efect of the new taste. My thoughts: <span class="bold">AWESOME!</span> The next morning, I tried it my normal way, in the blender with a banana. The Greenberry has moved to the poition of favorite Shakeology flavor. For real! I hated the old formula, and was turned off by the green color. But, I am all in now!!</p>
