I am a fitness coach and trainer with a background in dance. Stretching has always been a huge part of my fitness routine. Yet, sometimes, I slack on stretching just like everyone else. I have observed that flexibility is the most neglected aspect of fitness. Generally speaking, once we have crushed a workout, we just want to hit the shower or seek calories. The last thing on our minds is to put in a nice, long stretching session, even though our muscles are nice and warm, perfectly primed to improve flexibility. We forget that stretching and flexibility could quite possibly be the fountain of youth and the key to success.

I was doing a bit of research on stretching for golfers, since that has been a huge focus for me with my client base lately. One of the first things I found was a spot on The Golf Channel about flexibility. Dustin Johnson, who just won the 2016 U.S. Open, was quoted as saying this: 

<p class="centered-text bold italic">

“Most people probably think my height and strength are the whole thing; but a lot of my distance actually comes from my flexibility.”

</p>

A little more research revealed several different stretching routines that Dustin Johnson uses pre-game, as well as in general conditioning for his game. I was thrilled to find all of this, because it validated the work I have been doing with my clients who are avid golfers. I introduced simple yoga patterns, posture exercises, and breathing techniques to one self proclaimed “recovering gym rat.” He felt improvement almost immediately. I remember him texting me after his very first session to tell me he had slept through the night for the first time in years without the familiar, nagging shoulder pain that used to keep him tossing and turning. 

A few other golfers came on as clients, and I began teaching them ways to use stretching and dynamic flexibility training to enhance all of the other things they were doing for fitness. As a result, they have excitedly come back to tell me they are noticing improvements in their golf game. I think some people (including myself, until I started playing golf!) underestimate how athletic the game of golf really is; there is an amazing physical complexity to the golf swing. That being said, cross-training, including cardiovascular endurance, resistance training, balance training, and flexibility are all essential if you’d like to be on top of your game. 

So, check out the following stretches that are specific to priming you for your best golf game:

1)	**Getting arrested stretch**– Hold on to the top of your club handle. Step back and lean forward with a flat back until your feel a stretch through the armpits into the back muscles.

2)	**Backswing stretch** - Place the club (I put the handle side down.) directly in front of you. Left hand holds low and right hand high. Move arms to the right, keeping left hip pulling back. You’ll feel a stretch in the left shoulder.

3)	**Follow through stretch** – This time place right hand low and left high. Move arms to the left and feel the stretch in your right shoulder.

5)	**Hamstring and shoulder stretch** – Hold club behind your hips with hands wide. Keep the legs as straight as possible as you bend forward and let the arms go fall over your head.  Gently twist side to side for a further stretch.

6)	**Lunge Rotator** – Step into a deep lunge. Keeping your hips square, twist the upper body towards the front leg. You can make this a dynamic movement by adding a small moving twist back and forth. Just keep those knees in line with the feet and don’t let the hips move.

_**Have a great round!**_
