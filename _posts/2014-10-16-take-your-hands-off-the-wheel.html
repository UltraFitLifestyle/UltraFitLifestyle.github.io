<p>I learned some tough lessons this week. Constructive critics and downright haters have been giving me tough feedback. It took me by surprise and hurt my feelings. A lot more than I thought it would. I love the fitness industry because I feel it is my mission to help people discover a healthier lifestyle. Apparently, the way I look, the things I post on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/rachelayerstipton" target="_blank">Facebook</a> about my workouts, and how I come across rubs some people the wrong way. I had to really get quiet and <span class="italic">think</span> about that for a few days.</p>

<p>What I came up was twofold:</p>

<p>1) Haters are gonna hate. When haters come along, it is usually a sign that you are doing something <span class="italic">right</span>. You have suddenly reached a level of success that others envy. Or, your actions are a mirror to others of what they wish they could be. Be yourself, because you cannot and will not please everyone in this world. The ones that matter love you for who you genuinely are.</p>

<p>2) Sometimes is is an amazing thing to take your hands off the wheel for a while. Or, at least loosen the death grip on the wheel! Things will work out for the best. The world will not come to a screeching halt if you take some time for quiet reflection.</p>

<p>I tried this for a few days. I let go. I let God. I stopped <span class="italic">trying</span> so hard. I skipped my workout and did a meditation instead. (Yes, it’s really true!) And, you know what happened??</p>

<p>Amazing breakthroughs. New clients. Opportunity presented itself. And, I realized it’s ok to let go.....just a little. <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>
