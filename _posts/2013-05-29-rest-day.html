<p>I have been SO dedicated to the <span class="bold">Insanity</span> program this last 60 (well, officially Day 58 right now…) days. I have followed the program as it is prescribed to the very best of my ability. It has been TOUGH…I mean, not for the faint of heart!! But, BOY do I love my results so far. I have never felt so strong and lean and powerful.  BUT….</p>

<p>Yesterday, I did my regular 5:00 AM workout….it was Max Cardio Conditioning AND Cardio Abs (ugh!). Then, at 6:00 PM, I did a ballet class with <a href="http://www.nycdance.com/Home.aspx" target="_blank">NYCDA</a> master teacher <a href="http://www.jovodance.com/index.php?p=bio" target="_blank">Scott Jovovich</a>. I teach a <span class="italic">lot of dance</span>, but it has been years since I TOOK a ballet class as a student. Boy, oh boy….anyone who says ballet is not an intense workout is CRA-ZAY!! Kicked my butt just about as hard as Shaun T, only a lot softer music and less yelling from Mr. Jovovich!</p>

<p>Needless to say, when I woke up for my 5:00 AM <span class="bold">Insanity</span> workout, my body was begging for mercy. So, I listened! I thought about it and made a conscious decision to go back to sleep. Not because I was feeling lazy (well…..maybe a little…it WAS 5:00 AM!!), but because I had JUST read an article in <a href="http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/" target="_blank">Fitness Magazine</a> that warned about getting proper rest!</p>

<p>The article suggested that <span class="bold">REST</span> is of utmost importance in your workout regime. If your body does not get sufficient rest, especially between workouts, the body does not have enough time to recover itself fully. Overt raining can cause poor performance, increase risk of injury, and compromise desired fitness gains.</p>

<p>Well, ain’t nobody got time for <span class="italic">INJURY!!!!</span> And, I am going for super, ultra, mega fitness goals here, so I decided to rest this morning to optimize results…..I also always keep in mind over-taxing my body because that will throw me into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease" target="_blank">Crohn’s flare</a>!</p>

<p>Don’t hold it against me….I <span class="italic">AM</span> in fact almost finished with <a href="http://racheltipton.com/insanity/" target="_blank">Insanity</a>!!</p>

<p>Workout on deck: <a href="TURBOFIRE" target="_blank">TURBOFIRE</a>!!!!!!!! I am looking forward to Chalene Johnson’s fun workouts…it is almost like dance class! <a href="{{site.url}}/contact-rachel">Join me</a> and my gang of fitness fanatics for a June 3 start date!!!</p>

<p>Until then….be sure to get proper rest AND drink your <a href="http://racheltipton.com/shakeology/" target="_blank">Shakeology</a>!!</p>
