<p>I am a proud morning person. But, I admit, I sometimes get so caught up in my morning activities that breakfast gets second best status (workaholic….). Do you leave for work with only a cup of coffee on your tummy? We have all been there, and we all know how that turns out. They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day; here’s why!</p>

<p>Studies show that eating breakfast is important to maintaining a healthy body weight. There is a higher obesity rate in those who normally skip breakfast. People who eat breakfast regularly are more likely to exercise on a regular basis. We exercise fanatics burn so many calories that we can’t go for too long without being hungry!!  The important thing is to plan in advance and chose wisely!</p>

<p>Women who eat breakfast tend to eat fewer calories during the day. This is mostly because, the women who eat their breakfast don’t end up “starvation eating,” and grabbing whatever is available mid-morning. Breakfast also jump starts the metabolism so that calorie burn throughout the rest of the day is already in action first thing.</p>

<p class="bold">Top 4 Reasons You Should NOT Skip Breakfast:</p>

<ol>
<li><span class="bold">Skipping breakfast make you fat.</span> AARGH! That’s a great reason not to skip right?! As mentioned, you fall into the “higher obesity rate” if you tend to skip.</li>
<li><span class="bold">It makes you forgetful.</span> If you skip breakfast, by mid-morning, your mind is mush. Think about it: if your body craves calories and you aren’t fueling properly, the body starts to go into survival mode. So, thinking about your work is way secondary to the body searching out energy somewhere else….like breaking down your muscles for energy! Yikes!</li>
<li><span class="bold">Increased rate of Type 2 diabetes</span> in those that skip breakfast. This goes back to #1 above. Skip breakfast = get fat = higher chance of Type 2!</li>
<li><span class="bold">It makes you mean!</span> Another feature of survival mode….I don’t know about you, but I get seriously mean if I don’t eat. If I have a long morning at the office, I will warn my husband to stay out of my way until I get some food or Shakeology in me.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, now that we know we <span class="italic">SHOULD</span> eat breakfast, we must navigate what is <span class="italic">BEST</span> for breakfast.</p>

<p>You want to grab fruits, vegetables, and whole grains that are high in fiber, but low in fat. That way, you can eat more…YAY! The simpler the better. My top 2 breakfast choices are: <a href="http://racheltipton.com/shakeology/" target="_blank">Shakeology</a> or a bowl of mango, papaya, avocado, and walnuts. Yum! Both of these choices provide me with a complete and balanced boost of energy first thing.</p>

<p>Beware the beloved bagel in the morning! The density of calories is equal to that of 5 slices of bread! But, if you must do the bagel thing, skip the cream cheese. It is not really a dairy product as much as a smear of FAT across your bagel. Instead, go for honey or nut butter. Muffins and pastries tend to have little to no positive caloric value in the morning….that blueberry muffin has a lot more sugar and fat than fruit inside!</p>

<p>If you adore granola, try to buy low-fat and treat it as a condiment. Meaning, sprinkle a TBSP or 2 on top of your fruit. Eating a full bowl of granola can really pack on a ton of fat and sugar. Be sure to read labels on all breakfast cereals to be sure your serving size is not too calorie rich.</p>

<p>I hope I have inspired you to place importance on breakfast. It sets up the whole pattern of you eating habits for the day. So, keep it sacred and ENJOY!</p>
