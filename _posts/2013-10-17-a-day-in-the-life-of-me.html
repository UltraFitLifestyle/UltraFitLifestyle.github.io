<p>Hi there! I have had a few people ask me lately how I fit everything into my day: I am a <a href="http://www.litchfield-dance.com/" target="_blank">dance teacher</a>, <a href="http://www.litchfieldrealestate.com/" target="_blank">Realtor</a>, <a href="http://www.beachbodycoach.com/ultrafitdancer" target="_blank">Beachbody Coach</a>, Mom, <a href="http://www.pawleysislandmontessori.org/" target="_blank">Montessori school board member</a>, and also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease" target="_blank">Crohn’s disease</a> warrior! So, how do I do all of this AND workout 5-6 days a week AND remain sane?? Take a look at my day:</p>

<p><span class="bold">5:00AM</span> Rise and Shine!!</p>

<p><span class="bold">5:15 – 6:00</span> Get geared up, E&E formula down the hatch, and PUSH PLAY on my workout.</p>

<p><span class="bold">6:00 – 6:15</span> Meditation – this is a <span class="italic">MUST</span> for me lately. Sometimes it is harder than others to calm my mind.</p>

<p><span class="bold">6:15 – 6:30</span> Shower and fluff <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> I don’t mess around here; all business!</p>

<p><span class="bold">6:30 – 7:30</span> FOCUS on my Beachbody business. I do a “Power Hour;” making new contacts, sending invites, and following up with people who have questions they need answered.</p>

<p><span class="bold">7:30 – 8:30</span> Get Roxie up out of bed, ready for school, and TO school. She is tough to get up, so I now let her rest until the last minute! I also finish up any of my own personal fluffing for the day. <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>

<p><span class="bold">8:30 – 2:30</span> This area of my day is reserved for real estate business, errands, and whatever else needs done. Since my husband works at night, this is also our “hang out” time together. (This week it has included running around picking up auction items for the school fundraiser this weekend AND learning a 2 hour ABBA tribute show I will be performing with in about 2 weeks!!! Fun!)</p>

<p><span class="bold">2:30 – 3:30</span> Pick Roxie up from school, get snacks in her, and get to the dance studio.</p>

<p><span class="bold">3:30 – 8:30</span> DANCE CLASSES!!! Thursday and Friday, I get done at 7:30….bonus!! I am VERY lucky that Roxie adores being at the dance studio, so I get to be at work AND with her!</p>

<p><span class="bold">8:30 – 9:30</span> Eat, get Roxie a bath….and me, too!!</p>

<p><span class="bold">9:30 – 10:00</span> Settle down, bedtime stories, and ZZZZZzzzzzzzz……</p>

<p>It is very rare I stay up later than 10PM since I adore my early morning ritual. Saturdays I usually get up at 6:oo instead of 5:00 and then have dance from 10:00 – 4:00. Sunday is straight up family day…..unless I am showing real estate to a buyer!</p>

<p>It seems like a lot I know. I am pretty sure a schedule like this would make some people’s heads spin. But, I am in the groove of it. I LOVE what I do for a living and wake up excited every day. Living and working in Pawleys Island allows me to stay within about 5 minutes of home, work, and Roxie’s school at all times, so that helps! Sometimes I DO get tired, and fall asleep thinking, <span class="italic">“What am I THINKING??!!”</span> But, inevitably, I awake refreshed and ready for more action.</p>

<p class="bold italic centered-text">“Live like no one else, so one day you can live like no one else…..” – Dave Ramsey</p>

<p class="centered-text">I have <span class="italic">BIG DREAMS</span>, and right now, my Crohn’s is under control thanks to right living and good nutrition, so I can keep this pace. I will keep the pace going until I am 40…..that’s 3 years. Then, my life can cool off ’cause my debts will be paid and my emergency fund will be in place!!</p>
