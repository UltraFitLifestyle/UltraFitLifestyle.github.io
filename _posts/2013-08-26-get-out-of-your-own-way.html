<p>What is easy to do in fitness, nutrition, and life in general is just as easy NOT to do. So what is getting in our way? Our own selves!!!! Our weak little minds telling us we can’t or it is not worth it or go back to bed….so what to do?</p>

<ol>
<li><span class="bold">Flush your glass daily.</span> Our heads are sometimes easily filled with our own negative thoughts and information coming from the outside world. “Flush your glass” by reading or listening to positive books and audios so that your mind stays focused on GOOD and productive thoughts.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Keep your circle of five sacred.</span> Your circle of five are the 5 people you associate with most often. Think about your 5 closest buddies. Are they a GOOD influence? If not, re-consider spending too much time with them and find positive and motivating people to hang with more often.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Build a routine.</span> Create a ritual; especially upon waking and right before bed. If you take a few moments to start and end the day with some sort of positive few moments, you will be able to handle the rest of the day more effectively.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Write it down.</span> I am a huge believer in writing down goals and dreams and checking them often. I also think if something is bothering you, writing it down helps get it all out. So, go by a cute new journal and write it all down!</li>
<li><span class="bold">Keep busy!</span> There is a saying about idleness being the playground of the Devil. Well, it is true in our own minds. Stay active and busy with daily activities and your problems won’t feel so overwhelming. Even if it is cleaning out one closet at a time or organizing some old photos. Activity keeps the beast at bay.</li>
<li><span class="bold">EXERCISE!!!</span> You knew I would throw this one in….exercise helps you feel accomplished, gets those positive endorphins flowing, and moves you towards your goals of having that body that makes you feel good about you!!</li>
</ol>
<p class="centered-text">So, get out of your own way and get on it today!!!!</p>
