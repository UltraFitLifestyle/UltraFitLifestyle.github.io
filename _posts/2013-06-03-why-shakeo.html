<p>My life is hectic at times. I have a very busy schedule and a young child. I have lots of outgoing expenses, so I am always looking for ways to save a buck. I also workout like a maniac (currently just started <a href="http://racheltipton.com/turbofire/" target="_blank">TurboFire</a>) and teach dance at <a href="http://litchfield-dance.com/" target="_blank">Litchfield Dance Arts Academy</a>.  AND, I am a Realtor® with <a href="http://litchfieldrealestate.com/" target="_blank">Litchfield Real Estate</a>. SO, I need to be vigilant about the quality of fuel going into my body. Oh, yeah, there’s that pesky <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease" target="_blank">Crohn’s disease</a> that I live with each day, too, which makes it difficult at times for my body to absorb all the nutrients it needs.</p>

<p>My solution: <span class="bold italic">SHAKEOLOGY!!!</span></p>

<p>Why? You ask…well first of all it is easy and quick when I have no time to get lunch or breakfast together. Sometimes I get home from work and I am so ravenous, I could eat anything in sight. Instead, I whip up my fav Shakeology recipe (today, my fav recipe is the Chocolate Vegan formula blended with ice, coconut milk, a banana, and a TBSP of all-natural Peanut Butter) and drink it up. <span class="bold italic">YUM!</span></p>

<p>Also, Shakeology is chock <span class="italic">FULL</span> of all kinds of nutrients. I could not make a salad or meal that would be so full of good stuff…especially not in a hurry. Anything in liquid form is super Crohn’s friendly, because it is easily digested and absorbed. As a result of drinking Shakeology every day for over a year, I have seen my energy level go up substantially. I am ABLE to maintain a full schedule, teach dance classes (sometimes up to 6 hrs/day…) AND workout. A lot of folks with Crohn’s have trouble with energy levels…</p>

<p>Another benefit of Shakeology is that it helps reduce the damage from those dreaded free radicals that take a toll on the body every day. What does that mean??? Well, I don’t think would be as good as Wiki explaining that, so <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-radical_theory_of_aging" target="_blank">read more here</a>.</p>

<p>The cost of Shakeology is one thing people have issue with a lot. Well, here’s some food for thought (pun not intended lol!!):</p>

<p>A “healthy” meal from McDonald’s (i.e. a salad) will run you about $7; a sandwich with a bag of chips and a drink from our fab local bakery, <a href="http://www.kudzubakery.com/" target="_blank">Kudzu</a>, costs around $7; a lunch salad from TGIFriday’s will cost you between $7-10.</p>

<p class="bold">1 serving of Shakeology = $4.50</p>

<p>It’s really not THAT expensive to eat (or drink) healthy!! So <a href="{{site.url}}/contact-rachel" target="_blank">CONTACT ME</a> for a free sample of Shakeology today! You will not regret how your life will change for the better!!!</p>
