<p>For the last 48 hours, I battled it out with this year’s formidable Stomach Bug. Ugh. My husband’s fight took a week. Roxie’s was nearly that long. I believe that because I am dedicated to fitness, healthy eating, and the UltraFitLifestyle, I was able to kick it in two days.</p>

<p>It has been a crazy two weeks at our house. Roxie got sick first, with a fever and tummy troubles. The fever was gone in a couple of days, but the tummy issues lingered all week. It seems the minute she got well, Tommy fell prey. And boy, did he get it! The poor man could barely keep a sip of water down for several days. He was administered fluids via IV and finally prescribed anti-nausea medication that is given to chemotherapy patients, just so he could keep fluids down. Quite an ugly scene indeed.</p>

<p>Through it all, I used Lysol like a samurai sword in my home. I washed my hands every time I touched either one of my “patients.” I drank Emergen-C and any other supplements I could get down the hatch. Protein and green leafy stuff as much as I could.</p>

<p>I thought I had conquered it, but the minute Tommy felt better, the bug bit me. Now, I have <a href="http://www.crohnsandcolitisinfo.com/Crohns?cid=ppc_ppd_yah_crohns_da_what_is_crohn_Phrase_64Z1572703" target="_blank">Crohn’s disease</a>, so spending time on the potty is familiar to me. This bug grabbed me and had me in the bathroom twice as much as I would on a bad Crohnie day. So, it was intense. But, only for about 12 hours. Then, my stomach leveled out and I was simply and quite literally drained.</p>

<p>After a week of struggling with the Bug, Tommy ended up with an earache. My ear began to hurt last night, about 36 hours after the onset. It has been very interesting to observe how quickly it ran its course through me in comparison.</p>

<p>I have been able to conquer my Crohn’s disease with vigilant healthy habits. I am on zero medication for my condition, controlling it well with diet, exercise, and meditation. This Stomach Bug should have hit me harder. I believe my consistent commitment to my health and wellness saved me.</p>

<p class="underline">Here are the steps I take:</p>

<ul class="bold">
	<li>lots and lots of water (at LEAST 1/2 your body weight in ounces per day)</li>
	<li>regular exercise, moving in some way 5-6 days per week</li>
	<li>eat as clean as possible, use the 80/20 rule</li>
	<li>drink a protein/health shake daily</li>
	<li>go to bed early</li>
	<li>minimize or eliminate alcohol consumption (I know….but it’s what I do)</li>
	<li>schedule meditation or down time each day to quiet the mind</li>
</ul>

<p>I will be teaching my 9:15 PiYo class this morning. It hurts me that I had to cancel my beloved clients yesterday. But, I am back and ready to bring it. Thanks to the UltraFitLifestyle!!</p>
