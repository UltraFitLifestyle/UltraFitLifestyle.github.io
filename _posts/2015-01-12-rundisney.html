<p>It’s 3:15AM and my alarm just went off. <span class="italic">I must be crazy</span>. But, my race packet says I need to be on a bus headed to the race site by 4:00AM in order to make it to the corral on time. It’s cold, and I decide to throw on an extra layer, gloves, and a hat. I quietly let myself out of the hotel room where Tommy and Roxie still sleep. It’s time for the <a href="http://rundisney.com/" target="_blank">Walt Disney World Half Marathon.</a></p>

<p>I started training in April of 2014. I was always the girl that said, “I only run if someone is chasing me.” Then one day, I went to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Chief-Big-Daddys-Boot-Camp/215427511803369" target="_blank">Chief Big Daddy’s Boot Camp</a>. I had heard he was hardcore. With a name like that, what can you expect? Chief is the former police chief of Pawleys Island. He runs local boot camps around the Grand Strand. He made me run my first mile. It was tough, but I was not the last one to finish. Two days later, I ran 2 miles. A mile in, it started to pour down with rain on my head. Boy, did I hate the Chief right then. But, after those two miles, I felt that runner’s high you hear about sometimes. I was officially hooked.</p>

<p>I really only wanted to sign up for the Disney 10K, but when I got online, it was already sold out. I asked my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/rachelayerstipton" target="_blank">Facebook</a> followers if they thought I could do the half marathon, and got a resounding, “GO FOR IT!!” So began my training. I got a plan from Hal Higdon and got to work. I added distance and speed gradually until I got to 15 mile long runs. (I was told that trainignpast the 13.1 half marathon distance was a good idea.) I ran the October 19, 2014 Myrtle Beach Mini Half Marathon in 1:56:56.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my first half marathon was 9 days after the cut off date to submit a qualifying time <img class="left" src="{{site.url}}/images/2015/marathon-sign.jpg" width="200" height="300" />for Disney. So, I was in the second to last corral. My friends in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/214188828719116/" target="_blank">South End Grand Strand Running Club</a> (a running club is an AWESOME way to motivate and inspire a novice runner!) advised me to get there early and push to the front of the corral. That is where the 3:15Am alarm came into play.</p>

<p>It was dark, quiet, and cold when I climbed onto the bus with my fellow runners. The bus driver actually got lost at first, and we ended up right back where he had picked us up! He finally figured it out and dropped us off at the race site. So began the first long walk. I could not believe how many <span class="italic">people</span> were on site for this race. It was unreal. Some were dressed in costumes, feather boas, and Mouse Ears. There were a lot of blankets wrapped and plastic bags wrapped around people in an attempt to keep warm. It was around 42 degrees. We all marched about a half-mile to the event area.</p>

<p>What a scene! Port-a-potties, charity run groups, clusters of people huddled together for warmth, and the first of many DJs along the race course blasting out music. I wandered around for a bit, but wanted to get to my corral. So, I started the next long march. It must have been at least a mile from the waiting area to my corral. I did get there in time to be right at the front. It was about 4:30 and still cold. There were only about 20-30 out of what would probably be several hundred in our corral. I was so glad I had opted to keep my extra layer on. I focused on deep breathing to keep warm and made light conversation with the folks around me. We waited and waited...</p>

<p>There was a bunch of build up from the stage at the starting line: the Wobble and the Macarena and a ton of announcements. I was in Corral O, with the first corral being Corral A. They kept asking, “How are you runners doing out there?” and “Are you ready?” Cold on the first question and YES on the second! More and more people arrived and headed for their corrals. I could not believe how many people were there to run. (total finishers: 22,081. At $189 per, Disney pulled a nice profit on race weekend. This number doesn’t even count park tickets and hotels on site! Cha-ching!!) Finally, the first corral got the starting gun, complete with fireworks. It was pretty cool! Corral O got to watch fireworks 14 times before we were up.</p>

<p>When it was our turn, I took off out of that gate! It felt so amazing to get moving after standing still for 2 solid hours. My feet were frozen, so it was a very strange sensation running at first. For a few minutes, I was blissfully alone. The corrals were released a few minutes apart, so there was no one ahead of me for a short time. I was aiming for an 8:45-9:00 pace, and got there when I hit the sea of people. There were so darn many people!! I started the dodge and weave in an attempt to keep my pace. It was still dark, and we had several miles to run before we hit the Magic Kingdom. I just tried to get around people as best as possible, and stay polite. Runners, walkers, costumes, and excited chatter were all around. One really crazy thing was all of the clothing scattered on the side of the course. People tossed their outer layers to the side as they began to run. I was a bit tempted to stop and go shopping. I would shamelessly snag a Disney hoodie left behind. Those things don’t come cheap! However, I am guessing the disregarded clothing was from more experienced runners who knew to bring toss aways.</p>

<p>Captain Jack Sparrow and his pirate ship were the first photo stop. There were a ton of photo opportunities with various characters; all with a line at least 10 people deep. I had decided before the race that I was not going to stop for character photos, because I wanted a strong finishing time. I <img class="right" src="{{site.url}}/images/2015/main-street.jpg" width="225" height="300" />kept on trucking. It was cool to pass underneath the Walt Disney World entry sign. We continued on through some nondescript “backstage” areas. Suddenly, we turned a corner and we were in the middle of Main Street! There were cheering spectators as we headed up Main Street looking straight at Cinderella’s Castle. THAT was the coolest moment in the race for me. There was no stopping, as the course narrowed substantially at that point. I pulled out my camera for a blurry picture as I ran.</p>

<p>Onwards, through Tomorrowland and then on to Fantasyland. I witnessed a woman trip and fall, splitting her eye right open just in front of the Carousel. It was intense! Some people helped her up and I alerted the next Disney Cast Members I came upon that she needed medical. Next, as we ran under Cinderella’s Castle, Elsa, Anna, and Christoph waved at us. Poor Cinderella had been kicked out of her own castle to do photos out back! I supposed with Elsa’s popularity, it might have caused too much of a bottleneck to let people pose with her. Running and running, dodging and weaving, I kept pushing myself to keep my pace as much as I could. I lost track a bit as I enjoyed the magic of the happiest place on Earth. We headed through Frontierland and then we were out of the Magic Kingdom.</p>

<p>This is where it started to get tough. There was so much adrenaline heading into and through the Magic Kingdom. It was awesome! I had put so much effort into getting around people, I was getting tired. If I have the chance to do the race again, I will hold back for the home stretch. More characters and a handy Clif bar station offering gel packs came up. I don’t normally go for that sort of thing, but I needed the boost at the time. The last 3 miles included 3 hills that hurt. The final hill was up an on-ramp to an overpass, and there was a character dressed as a Soldier from Toy Story. He was well placed, barking orders at the runners to pick up our feet and get moving. “If you have time to walk, you have time to do push-ups!”</p>

<p>My Garmin was reading wrong, so I actually thought I had 3 more miles when I only had one. My IT band had tightened up and my knee was hurting me. But, I was determined not to walk. My pace slowed to between 9:30 and 10:30, especially on those darn hills. Final stretch was into Epcot and around the Space Sphere. When I realized I was almost at the end, I pushed it a little. I knew I was not going to PR, but everyone had told me not to focus on that. I can’t really help myself, being so competitive and driven.</p>

<p>The Finish Line came up seemingly from out of nowhere. The cheering crowd made me feel like a Rockstar! Just past the finish line, a stranger and I made eye contact and both let out a loud “Phew!” <img class="left" src="{{site.url}}/images/2015/ice-pack.jpg" width="225" height="300" />We made it and received our medals. Disney offers some killer bling. My knee hurt, so I stumbled over to the medical self-care area. A friendly volunteer had a handy tool that basically Saran Wrapped an ice pack on my knee so I could walk with it. She handed me Advil and a couple bottles of water. Photos followed and a neatly packaged post-race snack pack.</p>

<p>I was so glad I decided to keep my outer layer sweatshirt. I considered tossing it mid race, but decided to keep it. Smart move! It was still quite cold when I finished my race. I was sweaty. Even when I put my outermost layer on for warmth, my teeth chattered. I wish I could describe the scene after the race, but I cannot. There were just so many runners and spectators and goings-on. It overwhelmed me a bit and I just wanted to sit down. I walked what seemed like one more mile over to the buses. I hopped on to find the same driver as in the morning. And, yep: he got lost on the way back to the hotel again! Hahaha!</p>

<p>Grabbing some hot tea, I limped my way all the way back to our room. Probably another mile; at least it felt that way. Roxie was waiting for me with Tommy. She was bouncing up and down ready to head to the Magic Kingdom. (Sigh!) She relented to letting me take a shower, rub my legs down with Doterra Deep Blue, and eat. I am really grateful to Disney for putting together such thoughtful post-race snacks. I think I had an hour of downtime total and we were on the move to the Magic Kingdom.</p>

<p>My husband said to me: “I think you should run a half marathon more often; Roxie and I can keep <img class="right" src="{{site.url}}/images/2015/marathon-weekend.jpg" width="225" height="300" />up with you now!” <span class="italic">Touche!!</span> I wore my medal proudly all day as I limped around the park. Everyone was congratulating me on my race. It was lovely! In hindsight, 10 hours in a Disney park after a half marathon is not the best idea. But, at least I was not alone. There were plenty of others with the same limp as mine. Some were Dopey Challengers, who had run a 5K, 10K, and had a full marathon the next day!! Wow. Happily sore, and feeling accomplished, we would catch one another’s eyes and smile, secretly knowing we shared a truly magical experience!</p>
