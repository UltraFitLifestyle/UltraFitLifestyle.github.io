<p>I am as much a fan of social media as the next person. I actually spend a lot of time focusing on social media marketing. However, social media is no substitute for real, human interaction. I think we sometimes forget that picking up the phone, or stopping by to see someone is more important than any “like” or comment.</p>

<p>Many people (including me) send out direct or indirect requests for help, prayer, or advice. But, how many of these virtual standers-by will actually <span class="italic">DO</span> something for you when you are truly in need. If someone posts that a loved one or pet has passed away, posting a comment saying “You are in my prayers” is wonderful. However, in loss, we human beings need <span class="italic">other</span> human beings for support...in the flesh, bearing covered dishes and hugs!</p>

<p>Even more close to home for me lately is the “moms helping moms” network. If a fellow mom is in need of an “emergency play date” in order to get something important accomplished, I am nearly <span class="italic">always</span> game. I will keep your kid, feed him or her, and be sure they are entertained. I will Like and Comment on your post begging for help. And, I will also follow up with a private message, text, or phone call to see if there is anything I can <span class="bold">REALLY</span> do to help you.</p>

<p>In business, and in friendship, the personal is the most valuable. Pick up the phone and get together with your friends. It’s kind of a lost art. You won’t regret it!!</p>
