<p>Are the holidays crazy enough for you yet? Has the pressure of gift giving and attending events hit you like the Holiday Express? I am hearing that from a lot of my fitness clients and feeling it myself. It is difficult to handle at times. But, you can survive it if you give yourself the gift of some “Me Time.”</p>

<p>I have been adjusting to a new location at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winyah-Fitness-Center-LLC/216757681719433" target="_blank">Winyah Fitness</a> in Pawleys Island. It has been a challenging transition. I am truly thrilled with the new clients I have there and the opportunity to help more people in 2015 to improve their health and wellness through fitness, nutrition, and mindset. But, the holidays are hectic, and with adjusting to this new schedule, I have all kinds of things piled on my desk and To Do list. My mind races at times. But, I make sure to schedule “me time” in my days or they do not flow as well.</p>

<p>Sometimes my “me time” is running on Pawleys Island. It is a wonderful escape to the outdoors to get some exercise that makes me feel good and enjoy the spectacular scenery. Other times, I simply light a scented candle, put on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlvUepMa31o" target="_blank">Clair de Lune</a>, close my eyes, and escape for 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Whatever it takes to quiet my mind, forget the stress, and rebuild my inner light.</p>

<p>Christmas (or whatever holiday you celebrate!) is not all about presents, although it sometimes starts feeling that way. I believe it is about <span class="bold italic">joy</span> and <span class="bold italic">love</span> and <span class="bold italic">family</span> and <span class="bold italic">miracles.</span> Take time for YOU this season.</p>

<p>Every day.</p>

<p>If you love yourself and find your inner peace, you will be able to share it with others.</p>

<p>Happy Holidays!!!</p>
