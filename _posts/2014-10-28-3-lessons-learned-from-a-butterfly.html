<p><img class="left" width="150" height="150" src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/catterpillar.jpg" />If you follow me, you know I have been struggling with changes and revelations lately. I try to have a positive outlook on things and people, but I am truly having a tough time. I am pretty sure it happens to everyone. Only thing to do is look fear straight in the face and figure out how to conquer it. This morning, I started thinking: “I wish I could just curl up in a cocoon and come back out after a time as a completely transformed person.”</p>

<p>Then, I realized I actually <span class="italic">AM</span> in transformation, and that’s why this is all so tough! I <span class="italic">WISH</span> I could hide away while I transform, but life goes on, and stuff has to get done every day! Here are the lessons I can learn from a butterfly during my own metamorphosis:</p>

<p><span class="bold">1) Change is perfectly natural.</span> The caterpillar is likely perfectly happy crawling along munching on leaves to his heart’s delight. I am not certain the caterpillar really <span class="italic">wants</span> to go through the metamorphosis. Does he even <span class="italic">know</span> how great it will be after the change happens? I am betting that, like us all, there is no way of knowing that one day, perhaps after a painful journey, he will be able to fly!</p>

<p><span class="bold">2)  Change is difficult and often ugly.</span>  Once the cocoon is around the caterpillar, it gets tough. In a squished up place, wings sprout from its back. <span class="italic">OUCH!</span> During our own transformations and growth, it would be nice to be isolated. But, our fear, pain, and confusion are sometimes exposed to all the world. Or worse, our inner struggle gets taken out on others in emotional outbursts.</p>

<p><span class="bold">3) The right transformation is miracluous.</span> It truly is amazing to watch a butterfly emerge. The old caterpillar is all but<img class="right" width="150" height="150" src="{{site.url}}/images/2014/butterfly.jpg" /> forgotten in the new being’s glory. The butterfly has the power of flight, and an entirely new perspective on the world that the caterpillar may never have imagined!</p>

<p>So, I am letting my metamorphosis happen. When I come out the other side, I bet I will fly higher than I thought possible.</p>
