<p>Well, Roxie and I have both been sick for the last few days. There is a gift in the fact that I was too busy being sick to spend any money. There’s always a silver lining.</p>

<p>Yesterday, feeling a little better, but still stuck in bed, I managed to spend money shopping online. The three purchases I made were things I have thought through for a while. They were not boredom impulse purchases. One was a necessity: a mat for underneath my low aerial rig at my studio. The one I have right now I do not find sufficient, so that was an important business investment for everyone’s safety. The other two purchases were ME purchases: I needed to replenish my <a href="https://ultrafitskin.myrandf.com/" target="_blank">Rodan+Fields</a> stash, and I needed to restock my <a href="https://ultrafitlifestyle.1stphorm.com/" target="_blank">1st Phorm Phormula 1</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://ultrafitskin.myrandf.com/" target="_blank">Rodan+Fields</a> is an amazing skincare line that I offer to YOU. I struggled with acne for years and years <img class="right" src="{{site.url}}/images/2016/rodanandfieldsthumb.jpg" width="150" height="150" />until I was introduced to R+F. Since starting my Soothe regimen, I have had little to no blemishes. I never wear makeup to cover my blemishes anymore. I even wear heavy stage makeup for Legends in Concert and maintain clear, glowing skin. R+F has a solution for every skincare concern, including wrinkles, acne, sun damage, and sensitivity or redness. There’s even a solution for men’s razor burn! Contact me if you have a skin concern, and I will help you find the right regimen to give you UltraFitSkin!</p>

<p><img class="left" src="{{site.url}}/images/2016/phorm1thumb.jpg" width="150" height="150" />I have tried just about every supplement company out there. I finally settled on <a href="https://ultrafitlifestyle.1stphorm.com/" target="_blank">1st Phorm</a> as my preference. They offer high quality products, a great price point, and an awesome philosophy on fitness and education on supplementation. My biggest reason for loving 1st Phorm? Convenience. I <span class="italic">KNOW</span> that a protein shake in the morning as well as post-workout are perfect for me. I have a busy schedule and no longer have time to carry around a blender and a bunch of other stuff to make my shake taste good. <a href="https://ultrafitlifestyle.1stphorm.com/shop/level-1/dp/4268" target="_blank">Level 1 (meal replacement)</a> and <a href="https://ultrafitlifestyle.1stphorm.com/shop/phormula-1/dp/4267" target="_blank">Phormula 1 (post-workout protein)</a> are both constructed to mix with water AND taste great. Of course, I could go on all day about the benefits and features of the products. But, it boils down to convenience and taste for me. Contact me if you are looking for UltraFitNutrition through a weight loss enhancement or a supplementation program. I can help. Ask me about the <a href="http://www.mytransphormationstartstoday.com/" target="_blank">MyTransPhormationStartsToday</a> contest!</p>

<p>Ok, ya’ll get out there and have a fab day, I will be back to kicking butt and focusing on my UltraFitFinances!</p>
