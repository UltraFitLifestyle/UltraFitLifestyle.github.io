I posted this question on Facebook the other day: _WHY_ do you workout?

I was amazed at how many people responded. I assumed people would say that they workout to lose weight, get skinny, or look good. I was way wrong! The majority of comments were about how exercise makes you _FEEL_. Check out some of what my friends and followers had to say about **WHY** they workout:

•	To feel alive

•	To feel more energized

•	To challenge myself

•	Stress relief

•	Weight control

•	_“Physically moving my body helps me stay mentally focused.”_

•	To try to stay young

•	To prevent a heart attack and disease

•	_“It’s my therapy.”_

•	For mental decompression

•	For mood enhancement

•	For _“me time”_

•	To stay limber and youthful

•	To be around nice people at the gym

•	To control anxiety

•	To feel less guilty about eating what I want

•	To feel stronger

•	To boost endorphins

•	To improve sleep

•	To sustain a higher energy lifestyle for work AND play

•	To make the outside world disappear for a while

•	To have the endurance and stamina necessary for me to fulfill my PURPOSE in life each day

•	_“Because it is something I get to do today and knowing that one day I will wish I still could.”_


All of the above are awesome reasons to workout! I encourage you to take the time to figure out exactly why **YOU** want to get focused on your fitness goals. You know **WHAT** you want: you want to get into better shape than you are right now. You know **HOW**: start and exercise program and improve your nutrition. But, **WHY** do you want these things?

Getting fit and losing weight are actually very simple things to do. It’s a math equation: start burning calories, eat the right amount of calories in the right quality, and it will sort itself out. The problem is that change takes time. Change takes patience. Change takes persistence. All of these things are difficult to nearly impossible to achieve if you do not have a good strong reason _WHY_. You need a reason to keep going when you feel like giving up. Everyone hits the wall when they are trying to reach a goal. It’s inevitable. If you have a strong WHY, it will power you through the tough times. 

**How do you nail down your WHY?**

Take out a piece of paper. You can do it on a note on your phone, but paper and pen are always better. Set the timer for 5 minutes and start writing. Write down what you want to achieve: lose 10 lbs, run a marathon, fit in a size 10, lower your blood pressure, etc. Once you have that specific and measurable goal, start digging deeper into WHY you desire that outcome. So, you want to feel better..._WHY_? You want to look better..._WHY?_ You wish to extend your life..._WHY_?

This is where it gets good. Perhaps the real reason you want to get into shape is because your marriage is on the rocks. You want to ignite your partner’s passion for you again by getting yourself “together” physically. Perhaps you are hoping to attract a partner. Maybe you have a wedding or a reunion coming up and you want to show up looking great and filled with confidence. If you have had a health scare, or discovered some startling numbers at the doctor’s office, you may feel strongly about saving your own life so you can be around for your family. Want to make more money, but lack the energy to show up as your best and most productive self? Whatever it is that is truly nagging at your heart and compelling you to take steps in the direction of better health, get it down on paper. Look your WHY dead in the eye. Accept where you are right now. And, get excited about where you are headed. 

You can achieve ANY goal. You can make any dream come true. It might not be easy, and you will encounter obstacles. Once you have your WHY down on paper, you can post it everywhere: on your bathroom mirror, on the fridge, on the back of the front door, on the dashboard of your car. Place reminders of your WHY around your home where you will see them. Put a note on your phone. Enlist a friend or a trainer or a mentor to help encourage you.  Your WHY is unique to you. Let it drive you to success!
