<p>I was at an event recently and a friend of mine said, “You know, your <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ultrafitdancer" target="_blank">Facebook</a> posts are just a little bit TOO positive sometimes….”</p>

<p>I had to laugh, and respond that I know I post a LOT of positive images, quotes, and links, but there is a reason. It is NOT because my life is so perfect. My Facebook posts are one part to motivate and inspire YOU, and one part to motivate and inspire ME!!!</p>

<p>My life is certainly not easy, with a job at <a href="http://www.litchfield-dance.com/" target="_blank">Litchfield Dance Arts Academy</a>, another job as a Realtor at <a href="http://www.litchfieldrealestate.com/" target="_blank">Litchfield Real Estate</a>, and a third job as an <a href="http://www.beachbodycoach.com/ultrafitdancer" target="_blank">Independent Beachbody Coach</a>, as well as a 5-year old and a husband….it’s a lot! I also live with Crohn’s disease, which is a challenge in itself. But, I am not complaining; I LOVE my life. However, it does not mean that I am not faced daily with things going wrong, things falling apart, and people getting angry at me. It’s <span class="italic">ALL</span> in the <span class="bold italic">ATTITUDE!</span></p>

<p>As a society, we are pummeled daily, hourly, and sometimes on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ultrafitdancer" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, up to the second with negative, upsetting, and downright awful news from our families, friends, and media. What to do?? Well, inspired by one of my favorite authors, <a href="http://www.darrenhardy.com/" target="_blank">Darren Hardy</a> (author of <a href="http://www.thecompoundeffect.com/" target="_blank">The Compound Effect</a>), I like to “flush my glass” daily.</p>

<p>The concept is that if you take a glass filled with dirty, icky, yucky water and flush it with enough CLEAN water, it will eventually be all clean, clear, and ready to drink. Same thing with your mind: if you are constantly faced with challenges, bad news, and stressful information, try to “flush your glass” so to speak, by listening to positive audio, reading positive motivational books, meditating…..or visiting <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ultrafitdancer" target="_blank">my Facebbook page</a> (haha!!). Even if you are NOT feeling happy or positive, you can “fake” your way there by filling your “glass” with the good stuff. Many forms of therapy will suggest you <span class="italic">pretend</span> you are happy until you really are!!!</p>

<p>I also believe that we ALL need motivation, whether it is to workout, eat better, or focus more on things we need to get done or improve upon. I know every time I post something positive and motivational, I <span class="italic">COULD</span> be helping just <span class="bold">ONE</span> person get through a tough moment. That’s all worth it to me. <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>

<p>I don’t want everyone to think I am Miss Mary Sunshine, because I am certainly NOT that. I am no angel. I have plenty of character flaws, issues, and hangups….not to mention that pesky chronic disease. But, I am on a daily uphill battle to <span class="italic">BE</span> better, <span class="italic">DO</span> better, and try to make someone else’s life a little sunnier, if only for a moment.</p>

<p class="bold italic centered-text">Best wishes of heath and happiness today!!!!</p>
