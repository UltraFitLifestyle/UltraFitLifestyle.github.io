<p>Greenberry was the first Shakeology flavor I tried when I became a Beachbody Coach. To be honest, I <span class="italic">HATED</span> it and never ordered that flavor again. I guess I was not alone, because the company decided to give Greenberry a makeover. Now, it is <span class="bold italic">NEW</span> and <span class="bold italic">IMPROVED</span>, so they say. I am about to give it a test run. I only normally use the Vegan flavors due to my Crohn’s disease…results to follow…</p>
