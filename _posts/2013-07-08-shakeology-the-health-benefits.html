<p>A lot of people think about a protein shake and think weight loss. Well, many people DO drink health shakes to lose weight. I am one of those people who drinks Shakeology for the actual health benefits. I am a life long dancer, so I have always watched my weight (in some pretty unhealthy ways at times…). Do I want to cut body fat sometimes? Yes! Of course, I want to be shredded. <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> But, more than that, I want to be <span class="bold italic">HEALTHY!!!</span></p>

<p>I tried another form of liquid nutrition when I first realized that the foods I put into my body had bearing on my Crohn’s disease. This first liquid supplement certainly helped my energy level, but it was not a <span class="italic">COMPLETE</span> source of dense nutrition. It was just an extra somethin’, somethin’. When I looked into Shakeology, I saw that it had it all: protein, super foods, pre and probiotics, and more! I have faulty intestines, so absorption of food is an issue for me. But, in liquid form, I am able to absorb more of the nutrients my body wants and needs!! I drink it every day!! I am currently stalking the Fed Ex man because I ran out today. EEEEKS!!!!</p>

<p>Ask yourself if you need coffee to wake up in the morning, or a pick-me-up at mid-day? How much do you spend on Red Bull or Rock Star or other drinks like that?  How often do you take antacids or Tylenol for headaches? Is it <span class="italic">possible</span> that if your body got the nutrients it needed, some of your problems would go away??? Maybe, just maybe, all those doctors and health magazines that talk about how green leafy vegetables and fresh fruits are right??!!! And if you could replace 5 plates of salad with one yummy glass of Shakeology…..?</p>

<p>It might just be worth a try…..and luckily, Beachbody will refund your money 100% if you just don’t like Shakeology or have a poor reaction. Return the empty bag in 30 days and you get your money back. But, you won’t want to send the bag back. You will feel too good!!! SO why not try it, why not now….why not YOU???</p>
