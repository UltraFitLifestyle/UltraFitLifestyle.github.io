<p>When I was younger, I was a full-time performer and a part-time fitness professional. These days, the roles are reversed, and I only perform every once in a while. I always have an adventure when I hit the road with <a href="http://absalutegold.com/" target="_blank">AbSalute Gold</a>, the Abba tribute band in which I play Frida. However, going on the road does not mean I miss my workouts. Ok, so I don’t always get one in every day, but I DO get one in as part of my #UltraFitLifestyle. This past weekend was no exception.</p>

<p>I normally get up at 4:30AM, so last Saturday was no different. Only this time, instead of heading to the gym, I headed over to meet Jo-Ann, band leader of AbSalute Gold. We arrived at the airport and pretty much walked straight onto the plane. We walked off of that one and straight on to the change over flight to Boston, site of the worst weather in the country right now! The amount of snow was kind of surreal to this Pawleys Island girl. It took me back to the days I spent living in Montreal. Giant icicles, head high banks of snow, and business as usual!</p>

<p>A band of 10 people finally assembled at the <a href="http://reaglemusictheatre.org/" target="_blank">Reagle Theater</a> and we got the stage set up until late at night. The snow had started up again and was magical to watch (unless you’re a Bostonian, in which case, the magic faded a few weeks ago!). I got to bed as early as I could, know that there was a fitness center downstairs.</p>

<p>In the morning, I peeked outside to see even more snow piled up. I had packed a set of resistance bands in case the gym in the hotel was limited; <img class="right" src="{{site.url}}/images/2015/icicles.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="boston icicle" />which it was! There was a treadmill that did not work, an elliptical, and a recumbent bike. Pretty bare bones. However, there was a wall of mirrors and  some open space. No one was around, as they rarely are in a hotel fitness center.</p>

<p>I hit the elliptical for about 20 minutes, which actually winded me since I am not used to that particular machine. It is a great idea to change up your workouts sometimes, so that you can keep from the dreaded plateau. I also did as much of my regularly scheduled lifting routine, but modified with the resistance bands. It was not an epic workout, but the resistance bands DID bring the burn. Again, I was not used to that type of workout, so it was a nice challenge. There really is a way to keep active in <img class="left" src="{{site.url}}/images/2015/collage.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="ultrafitlifestyle" />the midst of a snowstorm while on the road; you simply must make it a priority.</p>

<p>With my workout complete, I was pumped up and ready for my show. It was a good one, to a full house!<img class="right" src="{{site.url}}/images/2015/absalute-gold.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="AbSalute Gold in Boston" /></p>

<p>To get home, my alarm went off at 3:00AM. Ugh. We caught a 6:00AM flight out and had seamless changeovers on the way home. It was a fun adventure, but I was happy to get home to Pawleys Island where there are palm trees instead of snow banks.</p>

<p>Eating on the road is a whole other challenge! I have ask <a href="http://thebewellcoachblog.com/" target="_blank">Leslie O’Neill</a>,  The Be Well Coach, to work on some suggestions for eating well on the road. I’ll keep you posted!</p>
