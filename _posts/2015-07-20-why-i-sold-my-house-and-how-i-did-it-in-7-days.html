<p>It might come as a surprise to you that we closed on the sale of our home today. As active as I am on social media, you probably did not have a clue. I was a bit superstitious about mentioning the sale until the deal was closed. The truth is that while the rest of America was celebrating and lying on the beach on the 4th of July, we were moving out of our house. The house went on the market on June 4, 2015. We had a ratified contract for a cash offer by day’s end on June 10, 2015. How did we do it? Why did we do it? Read on.</p>

<p>Since I began to focus on my fitness business in April of 2014, I have learned to look at my numbers: how much money I am making, where is it coming from, and where the money goes each month. At first, I was not a fan of looking at my numbers. I have since come to realize that success IS all about the numbers. There are some changes that I want to make in my business and I realized that the numbers were adding up wrong. The numbers told me that it was time to put the house<img class="right" src="{{site.url}}/images/2015/forsale.jpg" width="150" height="150" /> on the market. It was a sure fire way to get rid of a major debt, allowing me to invest in my business.</p>

<p>In April, I contacted my friend and Realtor at <a href="http://www.litchfieldrealestate.com/real-estate-staff" target="_blank">Litchfield Real Estate</a>, Henry Roberts. We crunched numbers together and came up with a fair market price for the house. The market has been heating up in Pawleys Island. Having been in real estate, I knew that if I priced it too high, it would not sell. I spent 2 months getting rid of clutter and neutralizing the paint on the interior. I had painted red walls in the dining room for a 50s diner effect, and some other bright colors in other rooms. Red walls are a tough sell in a house! So, I neutralized them with a fresh coat of paint.</p>

<p>By the time Henry got the house listed the first week in June, it was ready. He warned me of two things: 1) June is the worst time of the year to sell a house (Spring and Fall are the best times.); 2) The last house he listed in Hagley Estates sold in 5 days, so were we prepared for that? I was ready. I also drilled myself on staging the house for showings. When a buyer walks in a house, it needs to “feel” like it is ready to be sold. Stuff put away, cleaned up, and out of sight so the buyers can imagine themselves living there.</p>

<p>We had two showings of our house. Thank goodness I only had to clean up twice! The second showing yielded a cash offer with a pretty quick close date. We negotiated a bit, and the <img class="right" src="{{site.url}}/images/2015/boxes.jpg" width="150" height="150" />deal was ratified. Time to pack boxes! (Side note: when moving, look for perfect boxes at the liquor store. Every liquor store always has a surplus of sturdy boxes that are just the right size; not too big, so you can still lift them when they are full!)</p>

<p>What followed was 3 weeks of me working like crazy to get the house packed up. Four years in a house leads to the accumulation of some serious STUFF, even after getting rid of a lot in April. I have also been blessed with a full schedule of amazing clients this summer. My work schedule has been 5:00am to as late as 8:00pm. I love what I do, I love witnessing positive changes in my clients, and I love my daughter Roxie enough to keep at it, even when I am tired. Tommy has been in school for over a year, and I have been the sole income earner in my household, which is another compelling reason to push myself in business.</p>

<p>The 4th of July weekend arrived, with some serious South Carolina heat and humidity. Time for the U-Haul. Tommy and I moved boxes and furniture all weekend long. Once the big stuff was stashed in the storage unit, it took me two more weekends getting all the rest of the little things complete. Just when I thought I had packed the last box, I would open a closet and find more stuff. Ugh!</p>

<p>I did my final walk through of my “old” house yesterday. It was emotional for me. I loved that house. My friends always commented that it was a great house. It sure was. But, the Universe made it very clear, with how quickly a buyer came along, that it was the right choice to put the house on the market. It is time to move on.</p>

<p>Change is difficult. It is uncomfortable and sometimes emotional. I have received some serious clarity throughout this move. I know what I want to do with my business and my life path going forward. I was terrified the day the sign went up in our yard. It all worked out, as things always do.</p>

<p>Onwards to new adventures! Stay tuned....</p>
