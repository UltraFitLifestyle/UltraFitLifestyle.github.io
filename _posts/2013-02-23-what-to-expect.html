<p class="bold">FITNESS JOURNAL EXAMPLE</p>
<p class="bold green">DAY TWO OF P90X/PLYOMETRICS</p>

<p>Up at 5 am again. I am going to need to go to bed earlier, as it was not nearly as easy to roll out of bed this morning!</p>

<p>Took my supps, fried KC his eggwhites before he was out the door to work, set up my living room to look like “My Gym”, signed on to WOWY “Online Super Gym” and then pressed play. I don’t get to work out with music, as my kids are all asleep down the hall, and I have to keep the volume VERY low and do all my hopping, jumping, grunting, and straining as quietly as possible.</p>

<p><img class="left" width="300" height="199" src="{{site.url}}/images/2013/belly.jpg" />LOVE, LOVE, LOVE PlyometriX!! It works your legs something fierce, but all in good fun, and I love having new moves to learn. One thing about ME: I am pretty competitive, so I really try to keep up not only with the girls, but with the boys. (NO ONE can keep up with Tony Horton – every good competitor knows when they are outmatched!) Some sound advice I got before this workout: <span class="italic">“Don’t go at it like an animal or you won’t walk tomorrow”</span>. So I started out with those intentions. That lasted about 30 seconds. I was having so much fun the time flew as I worked my body like crazy in this routine. But not beyond safety and keeping good form; just a good hard workout that ROCKS!!</p>

<p class="bold">The inside tip of the day:</p>
<p class="green">“THINK CATWOMAN; NOT CRAZY WOMAN”.</p>

<p>Soft landing is the name of the game so our knees that have recovered from the SQUAT NAZI Debbie Sieber’s Slim in 6 will not be sore again!!</p>

<p>I am so excited to be going through this with all of you! It’s just a CRAZY program that will whip our bodies into tip top shape come day 90. And the fun of doing it alone in your house is that you really are competing with yourself. Yes, there are those on the tape who we compete with each time, but it’s a personal best against them. And no one standing next to you to make you feel less because you can’t keep up with them. In the flesh. It’s a beautiful thing, this home fitness idea. And then we pick back up our living room and no one is the wiser to our private fitness sessions, except that our sweatshirts are starting to bulge in the arms.</p>

<p>I’ve got someone coming for a haircut in a few minutes and I still have yet to take a quick shower. A good hot shower sounds good for my worked body right about now!! Check back in to see if I’m able to walk tomorrow!? I’m up a for a GREAT day today, after a BLAST of a start!!</p>

<p>Is it tomorrow yet?????</p>

<p>Bring it!</p>
