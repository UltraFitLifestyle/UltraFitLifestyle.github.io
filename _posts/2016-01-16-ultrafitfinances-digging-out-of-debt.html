<p>When the New Year strikes, most people include a health and fitness goal in their resolutions. The year 2016 is my year to focus on my own personal financial fitness. The debt that I carry right now causes me a great deal of stress. I live a wonderful life, providing for my family, paying all my bills on time, and enjoying activities that make me happy. However, I have lived beyond my means over the years and it is time to buckle down. I publicly vow that by this time next year, I will no longer feel the sting of my debt. I am going to focus on getting myself financially <span class="bold">FIT</span>!</p>

<p><span class="italic">How am I going to accomplish this?</span> Here’s my plan:</p>

<p><img width="150" height="150" src="{{site.url}}/images/2016/planner.jpg" alt="Dave Ramsey Enveolpe System" />1) <span class="bold">Track every cent.</span> A few years ago, I was introduced to the Dave Ramsey method of getting out of debt. My high school buddy told me about it. He and his wife dug themselves out of more than $50,000 in debt AND paid off their mortgage. It fascinated me and I started looking into it. I won’t get into all of the details of Dave Ramsey’s plan (you’ll have to buy the book or his <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/store/financial-peace-university/financial-peace-university-home-study-kit/prod163.html?ectid=bing.fpuhomestudy-sitelink" target="_blank">Financial Peace University</a> system for yourself), but I will say that it is not for the faint of heart. I have had to accept some ugly truths about myself, and my spending habits. I started using Dave Ramsey’s “envelope system.” Simply put, I only spend the cash I have on me. I have an envelope for food, for gas, for Roxie, for haircuts, for ‘me time,’ and so on. There is something about using cash instead of swiping plastic that makes one stop and pause when it comes to spending money. Also, I am tracking every cent that I spend. I created a spreadsheet and I write it ALL down. This also calls attention to my spending. I stop and think, <span class="italic">“do I REALLY need that?”</span></p>

<p>2) <span class="bold">Pull double duty.</span> I am looking down the barrel of a difficult 11 months starting February 1st. I bust my behind from sun up to sun down helping people in my fitness business. And, when February hits, I will be performing 6 nights a week at <a href="http://www.legendsinconcert.com/" target="_blank">Legends in Concert</a> as a dancer. (Side note: I am turning 40 on 2/19/16 and I am extra amused and proud of myself that I have the opportunity to dance on stage again. Never say never!) My schedule will be grueling. It will be fun, and I am happy about it, but it will NOT be easy. I am sacrificing time with Roxie and likely sacrificing some sleep. However, I know I need to pull double duty if I want to get ahead of my finances. Dave Ramsey says: <span class="bold italic">“If you live like no one else; later, you can live like no one else.”</span> This is my plan. I ran the numbers and found that the salary I will make in 2016 with Legends is almost exactly the amount of money I need to conquer my troublesome debt. And, working my fitness business during the day will cover the rest. This crazy plan of mine is going to take a great deal of focus. Focus on each moment, focus on taking care of myself so I don’t get sick, and focus on my goals so that I don’t lose heart. There’s a light at the end of the tunnel. It’s 11 months; not a lifetime. I must simply keep my feet moving in that direction. It is going to be uncomfortable, but not nearly as uncomfortable as being stressed about money for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>3) <span class="bold">Pray.</span> I believe that any type of big goal or lifestyle change requires help. God did not put us on the Earth to do things all alone. If you are starting a new fitness program to lose weight and get healthy in 2016, I hope you have someone to help keep you accountable. (If you don’t call me!) I have an amazing business Coach, <a href="http://www.ginaandcompany.com/" target="_blank">Gina Trimarco Cligrow</a>, who keeps me accountable in all things business and financial. I have systems and habits in place that will help keep me on track. However, there <span class="bold">WILL</span> be moments when I will falter. I will get tired. I will mess up. I will face difficulties and setbacks. And, I will be praying every morning and every night for the strength to stick with the plan. My faith has grown substantially in the last few months. I have seen miracles happen in my life by staying focused and praying for help. “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” And, I can <span class="bold">DO</span> this!</p>

<p><span class="italic">WHY am I doing this?</span></p>

<p>It’s simple. I want rid of that icky, stressful feeling that comes when I think about my finances. I have some big goals and dreams that I want to accomplish, and I cannot do that with my finances being what they are today. I want to be available to Roxie as she enters her teenage years, not working all of the time to keep up with my spending. If I focus for the next 11 months, I CAN do that! I am excited. I am terrified. And, I <span class="bold">KNOW</span> I can do this. Stay tuned....</p>
