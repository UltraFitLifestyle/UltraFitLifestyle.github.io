Have you ever sat next to someone on a plane who was morbidly obese? Did you shift over a little bit so you would not have to touch them?

Have you ever looked at a fat person and wondered: why don’t you _DO_ something to _fix_ yourself? 

Now stop for a moment and change the perspective: if you shifted away from a person of color sitting next to you, you could be considered a racist. If you expect a homosexual to stop loving their partner, you could be considered a bigot. So, why do we have so much trouble accepting someone for being fat?

In the last few days, I have listened and re-listened to a fascinating episode of [This American Life](http://m.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/589/tell-me-im-fat), which delves into how we, as a society, view fat people. There were several different guests on the show. The first was a writer who decided to “come out” as fat. It was an interesting way to put it, because everyone can actually _SEE_ that a person is fat. What she meant was that she was admitting she was fat and announcing that she was perfectly happy that way. I venture to say that many of us look at a very fat person and unconsciously judge them that they should control themselves and try to lose some weight. If you really think about it: that thought process is just as unfair as thinking that someone who is gay should “fix” that part of themselves. 

This writer and speaker, named [Lindy West](http://www.lindywest.net/#about), described being fat as **“being way too visible and at the same time being invisible.”** It is true that society silently judges and publicly shames obesity. There is a mean and dehumanizing connotation to calling a person super morbidly obese. (That’s actually a medical term.) Maybe, just maybe, a person can be fat and be happy. Maybe we should stop judging people by how they look on the outside. Lindy also says: **“Want to change how you see fat people? Try it.”**

So, is obesity really that unhealthy? The next writer and guest on the show was a “recovering” fat person named [Elna Baker](http://www.elnabaker.website/).  She lost over 100 pounds and entered into the society of thin people. Her story was bittersweet. Once she was thin, she noticed how differently people treated her; how men treated her. She abandoned “fat Elna” and threw away all photos of her past. She lived in fear of people finding out she had once been fat. She suffered through painful surgeries to get rid of the loose, extra skin left behind after losing the weight. She admitted that she is addicted to diet pills and takes them almost constantly in order to stay thin so that people will like her and she can continue to find work. She confessed that she wished she had stayed fat. She was happier then, and did not actually suffer any of the terrible health problems we hear about in the statistics because she was plump.

**Is a life of sadness, fear, and insane behavior towards food any better than being fat by some doctor’s standards?**

I can remember reading an article a long time ago that pointed out that body images have changed throughout history according to the availability of food supply. In the 1400s, Renaissance women were plump. High society people wanted meat on their bones to show that they could afford food. In modern society, the rich are paper thin, showing they have them means to eat ultra healthy and access to the best trainers. 

I spend my time as a fitness coach trying to help people increase their level of fitness and _FEEL_ better inside their bodies. Because of my long history battling eating disorders, I am very sensitive to the word “fat.” I am careful not to focus on a person’s weight unless they want to. I am all about creating an environment that encourages strength and empowerment. However, you have to admit that the majority of people’s quest for fitness comes down to getting thinner and looking good.  And, we want to look good enough that other people think we look good.

What’s going on in America that we are the leader in obesity on the planet? There’s so much more to it than food. There’s so much more to it than exercise. It’s about how we _FEEL_ about ourselves. I was just in line at Starbucks and commented to a woman in a cross fit T-shirt that she had great legs. She responded by making excuses for the breakfast she and her husband just finished. And, they are on vacation. I was at a government office yesterday, and the woman I was working with began making excuses for herself about how she needs to get in better shape. She was beautiful, and I told her so. 

Why can’t people (especially women) be comfortable in our own skin? There are a thousand answers that point to the media and pressure in our society. Truth is: I have a hard time with it, too. Start with encouraging the person in the mirror. You are beautiful just the way you are. Continue the journey towards an even better version of you, no matter what size that is! If you respect yourself, then it is much easier to respect others. Next time you see a person you qualify as “fat,” remember that they already know how society feels about them. Chances are that they have tried to lose the weight. And, there is a great possibility that they are just fine with how they look and feel. So, love them as any other human being on the planet!
