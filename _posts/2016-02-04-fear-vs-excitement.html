<p>I have so much going on in my life lately, I can hardly sleep. My mind is buzzing. Most of it is great stuff; some of it is not so wonderful. I worry. I mull stuff over in my mind. I work stuff out in my head. Sometimes it feels like fear and sometimes it feels like overwhelming excitement. The truth is that fear and excitement are the same basic emotions.</p>

<p>Imagine a time when you were afraid. Perhaps you were giving a presentation or speech, you were going in for a job interview, or walking through a dark room in a simulated haunted house. What physical sensations did you experience? Heartbeat racing, hard to breathe and calm down, sweating a bit, agitated and jumpy...sound familiar?</p>

<p>Now, imagine a time when you were super excited, such as the night before going on a vacation to Disneyworld, the morning you got married, or the last day of school. What physical sensations were you feeling <span class="italic">then</span>? Heartbeat racing, hard to breathe and relax, sweating a bit, agitated and jumpy....yep, same things you experience with fear.</p>

<p>Take a roller coaster for example: my daughter was terrified the first time she got on a roller coaster. Maybe you can relate. The fear of the unknown brought her to tears and many times, she did not even get on the ride. Finally, when she overcame her fear and actually got on for the ride, she LOVED it! Fear flipped to excitement and she wanted to go right back on again. Her previous fear was really a figment of her own imagination.</p>

<p>So, if fear and excitement cause the exact same <span class="italic">physical</span> response, we can use this to our advantage, right? Notice the next time you are feeling fearful. Donâ€™t get upset about it. Use it. Flip it. Perhaps it is actually excitement after all! Go ahead: move past your fears and ride to roller coaster of life!</p>
