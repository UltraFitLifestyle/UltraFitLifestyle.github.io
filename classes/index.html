	<p><span class="bold">Pound:</span> The workout fuses cardio, Pilates, isometric movements, plyometrics and Isometric poses into a 45-minute series. Burn between 400 and 900+ calories per hour, strengthen and sculpt infrequently used muscles, and drum your way to a leaner, slimmer physique – all while rocking out to your favorite music! Through continual upper body motion using our lightly weighted drumsticks, called Ripstix®, you’ll turn into a calorie-torching drummer, POUNDing off pounds as each song flies by. Rock, rap, dubstep, pop and old school music fuse to create the POUNDtrack series.</p>
 
	<p><span class="bold">Flight School:</span> This is our aerial fitness small group class! Aerial fitness is not limited to someone who is already super fit. Anyone can gain the benefits of strengthening, lengthening, and toning the entire physique on the aerial apparatus, using movements based on yoga, ballet, Pilates, and circus. The group class format is taught in a circuit, with each student working on an aerial skill, then moving on to skills on the ground that will enhance the experience.</p>
 
	<p><span class="bold">Circus Conditioning/Stretch:</span> For the student who wants to take aerial fitness to the next level, this class will improve strength and flexibility required to move into more challenging skills on the aerial fabric and trapeze.</p>
 
	<p><span class="bold">PiYo:</span> PiYo combines the muscle-sculpting, core-firming benefits of Pilates with the strength and flexibility advantages of yoga. And, we crank up the speed to deliver a true fat-burning, low-impact workout that leaves your body looking long, lean, and incredibly defined.</p>
