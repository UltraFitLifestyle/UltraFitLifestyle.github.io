<h1>Results</h1>
<p>“Rachel- our hard work is showing some benefits! My A1C number is down by about 16% which is great! Another 10% to go. My doc said when her patients come back for this type of follow-up only about 30% of them have progress like this and avoid medication.<p>

<p>So, I am pretty dang happy and thank you for your help in accomplishing this!  Instead of celebrating with food (probably something bad for me- i.e. Taco Bell!)- I bought a few pair of capri workout pants!”<p>

<p>"I had heard myths & legends that exercise not only helps your body, but also your mind.  As a full-time working mother who had not routinely exercised in years, I was skeptical.   Looking for physical improvement, I reluctantly joined some neighborhood friends for Rachel Tipton’s bootcamp in May.  Rachel immediately recognized the strengths and weaknesses in our group, pushed us as far as she needed to, and after the first class and a few sore muscles I was ready for more.  That first month was intense; 5am wake-up’s, sore muscles, pushing myself.   It was not until the month-end sales meeting at work that I realized an even bigger result.  I had sold more homes the month of May than any other month of my sales career…. In over 6 years.  I absolutely attribute this to bootcamp.  As I worked on my physical improvement, the focus, energy level and discipline Rachel helped me find directly resulted in mental improvement.  A very tangible result!  I’m so thankful to Rachel for committing to me, and look forward to each class with her.  So.. myth busted!  Exercise absolutely helps your body, your mind and even your spirit!<p>
